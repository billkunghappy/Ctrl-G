It proceeds well, better than you'd remembered your past one going, apparently learning to talk a bit earlier  gave you an advantage, and you do very well in school. You pop in for a moment when you're 5 to teach yourself some math, and as it turns out, you get through elementary school with straight A's in all of your subjects.\n\nAt this point you get a sudden thought, and look at the other versions of yourself in the theater. Are they getting involved in the progress of your life, too? You put the thought aside and go back to watching the film.\n\nWhen you are in 7th grade, and just starting puberty, you visit yourself again. You decide to give yourself another little assist, and with a bit of guidance, and adult confidence, you have your first girlfriend and lose your virginity before you're 13.  This gives your popularity a real shot in the arm, and you enter high school not just a star student, but popular with the ladies, too. You take another glimpse at the version of yourself sitting next to you, and he gives you a smirk. You pause for a second, then resume watching the move.\n\nIt's when you go to college that things start to get sour.",

She would tell me that I should stay away from them at all costs because it would hurt a lot. She did not want to scare me as a child, so she never told me that my allergy could be fatal, but as I got older I learned otherwise. I always avoided spending too much time outdoors, fearing that a bee would get close to me and sting me. I never told anyone about my fear of bees, and I never let it show. Outdoors, my mother always protected me from bees, but when I left for college, she could no longer protect me. She warned me many times to be careful on my own. I always told her that I would be fine, but deep down I was terrified. I stayed in doors as much as I could in my first two years of college, quickly running from building to building in order to avoid any bees. I always wore long sleeves and pants, even in the summer, in order to avoid any stings. My friends never questioned my actions and accepted me for who I was. My junior year of college, I decided to take a summer job in the city. My summer job was being a waitress at a hotel spa/pool. I had to serve customers inside of the hotel, but on occasion, I would need to go outside by the pool. One day, I met a nice boy out by the pool and we got to talking about school. I was so engrossed by our talk, that I forgot I was spending too much time outdoors. I was sitting on a lounge chair by the pool when I felt a bee land on my shoulder. The boy I had met told me I had a bee on my shoulder and I was paralyzed with fear, running back inside, hoping the bee would fly away.",

He goes up to her and quietly sits down and asks, \"Can I help you?\" In tears and a pained voice, Liz answers, \"I came here to find out how to be better so I could really find true love. But all the classes are about being yourself.\" Liz looks at Clive with fear and hesitation, and states, \"I can't really do that because, you see, I am a shapeshifter.\" She looks at him expectantly. Clive bursts out laughing and hollers \"SO AM I!\" Thrilled that they have found someone similar to themselves, they lock hands and walk off together. Maybe the class was a good idea after all."

He seemed to share her favorite interests, he liked the same type of coffee, and he was into the same kind of music she liked to hear. Granted, many of her ex's were the same, sharing many of her favorite interests and hobbies. To her, however, Mike seemed to be a bit different than her past dates. He seemed a bit mellow and reserved, being passive and waiting for her to speak and make the first move. A welcome change than her past dates, who seemed to be more active and confident. On the date, Mike still appeared meek and nervous.\n\n\"Relax, I'm not going to bite you,\" Clara mentioned to Mike, who looked down on the menu to avert his eyes from hers. \n\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable,\" Mike spoke, in a tone just above a whisper.\n\nSure enough, the dinner went fairly well, and she was content to be with Mike.

She wondered how hard it might be for him to form a long-time relationship, and if others like him were successful in doing so. Smiling at him and motioning at the TV, Clara and Mike resumed the movie, continuing their date. They continued to date long into the future, now closer to each other given that Clara is aware of Mike's true identity. Mike himself, decided to stop lying to Clara about who he is and regarding his personality, and found that she liked him quite more than the first time they went on a date.

He is good looking, and seems to be charming. He certainly had a way with words. They were going to her favorite Italian restaurant, and she was running a little behind.

She was worried, and she needed to get away from this. She decided that she cannot date anyone for a long time because she will never know if it is this same guy. \n\nThe woman didn't go on any dates for well over a year. In fact, she quit looking for the perfect man altogether.\nOne day a few years later, she was at the grocery store. She was carrying quite a few products, walking up to the register to pay. She accidentally dropped the bread, and a man behind her picked it up. \"Hi, I'm Steve.\" They began to talk, and Steve asked her to get coffee sometime. She agreed, and the two connected beautifully. After several years, the two got married. They had so much in common.\n\nThe one nagging thought she could never get rid of - How did Steve know to ask me for coffee? Coffee was her favorite first date location. How did Steve know that?"

She loathed the way that some would throw others under the bus just to make themselves look better in the relationship.\n\nShe told him about the guys she had dated, and how she had felt an intense connection to them.

But then he explained to her that all of the men had been him. Every good part of the previous men were still there. But with each time he failed with her, he learned what he had done wrong and kept trying. And now finally he was literally her perfect man, because he had spent years learning from his failure to be just that. It was overwhelming for her and she knew that it would take awhile to sink in. But for now, she was content to relax herself in his arms, marveling over how one person could have possibly loved her that much.

He tells her that he is madly in love with her and has been trying to get it right, so that he could be with her forever. John tells Rachel that she is the only woman he has ever loved, and he will never hurt her again. Rachel is shocked and surprised that John has been doing this for so long. She does not know if she wants to stay with John or leave him. She goes home with her parents and thinks about what John has told her. She realizes that anyone who would go through that much trouble for her is someone worth keeping. Rachel goes back to John and tells him that she loves him and wants to stay with him. John tells Rachel that he will be more honest about his shapeshifting. He tells her that he will tell her when he is going to transform, so she will be prepared.

It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.\n\nBob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He collapsed on the kitchen floor.  He was unable to do anything as he drifted off into an odd dream. When he awoke, he was in the same spot in the kitchen.  However, the mysterious plant had disappeared.  Bob was surprised that he had returned to the present time. \"I discovered the key to time travel and didn't even know it,\" Bob said to himself.  From that time on, Bob regularly enjoyed traveling through time now that he knew how to get back home."

No one was sure why, though there were many theories. But, to be blunt, there was no time for testing theories or even questioning the facts. Children could use mana better, and were stronger, and that was going to have to be enough. \n\nThe children were trained to use their magic, and they were trained hard.

Proceed with the plan, and bring the children to the attack point in 30 days.\"\n\nThe plan was simple. The aliens' one weakness was that they were all linked to each other. And specifically they were all connected to what seemed like a literal mother ship. They protected it, shielded it, and guarded it with far more resources than was necessary. Even at the beginning, when humans were at their strongest they couldn't get close. It had to be the key. Destroy the ship and the aliens would be crippled. \n\nAt least that was what Commander Goran was counting on, praying for, begging to be true. And so they brought every child who could control mana at all as close as they could get. And the assault began.  \n\nAt the end of the day the Commander wasn't sure if it had gone well or not. The children attacked, and it seemed that the aliens realized the danger. Suddenly, using what was apparently transporter technology all of the aliens on the planet returned to the ship and boarded, some falling to the children's power as they went. And then the ship just...left. It took off and returned to space as far as anyone could tell.\n\nAs he frowned at the sky , Commander Goran was not sure if he should be relieved or not. Then a small girl approached him, with a strange blue light in her eyes, and an unnerving smile. \"Don't worry, we'll be here and ready for them when they come back.\" The Commander looked over at the children who had all grouped together, separate from the adults. They all had a strange glow, and a sense of power radiated from them. It felt almost inhuman. Almost...alien."

There are few humans left, and despite their magical power, their numbers are getting fewer. Also, as their numbers dwindle, and their magic strengthens, the survivors begin to change. They find that they care more for the magic,  than for each other. They crave the power that it brings, and the way that it makes them feel, and they begin to turn on each other. The struggle against the aliens is momentarily forgotten, as the surviving, increasingly powerful magicians, fight amongst themselves for the right to wield the magic. The aliens, who had been increasingly on the retreat, use this opportunity to attack the humans, and attempt to wipe them out.\n\nThey manage to kill many of the distracted magicians, but two manage to escape.  A man, and a woman, the last survivors of the human race, and the two most powerful magicians Earth has ever known. They manage to flee the alien forces, working together, and arrange a truce. Joining forces, they easily defeat the aliens, and save what is left of the Earth.\n\nThe alien menace dispelled, they turn on each other, and fight a final battle. The male magician has the edge, and is about to strike a mortal blow, but at the last minute, his powers reveal that his opponent is pregnant.

Riku didn't know what had ever happened to his parents; his grandfather refused to tell him.  He lived a lonely, isolated life and longed for a family outside his grandfather.  There were no photographs of his parents; the only picture was of a woman.  Sometimes he would see his grandfather gazing at the photograph, a wistful look on his face.  \n\nHis grandfather spent years training him, but it takes a long, long time to learn everything one needs to know to use magic to its full extent.  When Riku was 14, his grandfather passed away.  Riku had been kept at home his whole life and knew little about the world, but now he had to set out and find his way.  He decided to go to the city of Faltra, where he had heard from his grandfather that there were many people who could teach him about magic.\n\nRiku's first day in Faltra is a disaster.  They spoke a different dialect than he had learned growing up, so it was very difficult to get around.  He did have a little money and was finally able to find a room to rent.  He knew he needed to find a job, and find someone to continue teaching him magic.  Over the next few weeks, he learned the dialect and started to find his way around the city.  He got a job at a bakery, where he worked hard and met a lot of people as he waited on them.  He made friends with a young girl named Selphie, who was a waitress at the bakery.  They became friends immediately, and it was almost like they had known one another forever.\n\nOne day, Selphie invited Riku to come to her house for dinner.  Selphie lived with her grandmother. He arrived with some flowers he had picked.  When he knocked on the door, an elderly woman opened it.  Riku stood in the doorway, frozen solid.  It was an older version of the woman in the photograph that his grandfather had.  Riku knew it had to be her; he too had spent hours looking at that photograph.  The woman also stood very still, staring at him.\n\n\"Riku,\" she said.  \"Is it you?\"\n\n\"Have we met?\" Riku asked?\n\n\"Have you come here from Landro?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Riku said.\n\n\"Is Frezna your grandfather,\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Riku responded.\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"He died, and I came to Faltra to find someone to continue my magic education.\"\n\nThe woman motioned him inside, and sat heavily on the sofa, tears running down her face.  She told Riku she was his grandmother, and when his parent were killed by magic hunters, she and her husband had each taken one of the children and fled to keep them safe and keep teaching them magic.  Selphie was his sister!  By this point, she had joined them in the parlor and they both listed to the story their grandmother told.  She was teaching Selphie magic, but neither Riku nor Selphie's magic would be strong until they were reunited, as they were twins.  She hadn't known that her husband had passed away.  They hadn't seen each other in nearly 12 years, but had kept in touch as best they could.  \n\nRiku and Selphie were overjoyed to be reunited, and they spent the evening talking and catching up. Riku and Selphie spent the next year honing their magic and making plans for how to use their powers to return Mana to its past glory.  That would be their next adventure."

Riku is a very quick learner and is the top of his class. \n\nHis ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days.

Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world. \n\nThe story continues as Riku grows up and is forced to make decisions that will change the world forever. Koru gives Riku an ultimatum. Koru will go away forever but the only way to eliminate him is to eradicate 10 countries. Riku doesn't want to cause any harm. Koru won't budge on his ultimatum.\n\nRiku comes up with a plan to trick Koru. He casts a fake spell that is supposed to eliminate 10 countries in the world. He then casts a spell that turns Koru into a plant before he can even realize that Riku didn't actually eliminate the 10 planets. Koru lives the rest of his life as a plant. Riku lives the rest of his life practicing magic and leaving a positive impact on everyone he comes into contact with.\n\nRiku was able to defeat his arch rival and also save the world. A beautiful first chapter to this series. However in the next book a more powerful and more evil force will challenge Riku. Will Riku be up to the challenge or will evil triumph over good? For the sake of humanity lets hope good beats evil just like the cliche says."

Perhaps one of your kids is playing a prank on you. But you can't shake the feeling that it's real. You decide to call the number that is listed in the letter. To your surprise, it's a real number. As you place the call, you can't help feeling that your life is about to change forever. You are right! The voice on the other end of the line is familiar...it's John F. Kennedy! You are absolutely stunned that JFK is actually alive. You stammer when you hear is voice. Then he says \"Don't worry Barack, I know you're shocked...I'd be too if I were in your shoes. But honestly, you have nothing to fear. Just book a ticket to meet me tomorrow in the Caribbean.\" You are not actually sure if you can just drop all of your plans to head to the Caribbean to meet JFK. After all, you and Michelle were supposed to meet your neighbors for a game of checkers on their porch tomorrow, and then you and your friends were going to meet for some BBQ at Smith's BBQ Joint in downtown after that. But you are also intrigued. Checkers and BBQ will have to wait. You book the first flight to the Caribbean you can find. You arrive at JFK's private island. He's already there waiting for you. You are beside yourself with excitement. How crazy is it that this man is still alive? What a strange and fantastic thing to experience! JFK dives into the details. He tells you that he's been in hiding all these years, working on a secret project. It involves creating a new superpower that will rival the United States of America. He tells you that he wants your help to implement the project. You are honored. However, you can't help but think that this superpower would be unpatriotic, especially if it is to rival the U.S. But JFK assures you that there is no such thing as an unpatriotic project. He says that the purpose of the superpower is to encourage the U.S. to continue innovating so it doesn't lose its edge. He says that the superpower is just to motivate the U.S. so it doesn't get too lax about its policies and then lose out to other countries that are real. You are interested in the premise of this superpower and on second thought think this sounds like quite a good idea. JFK has already drawn up the plans for the superpower in his lab. He says that all you need to do is bring these plans back to DC and introduce them to the White House. He tells you that they'll take it from there. You agree that you will speak with your colleagues in the White House.  JFK is delighted to have your assistance and tells you that you absolutely won't regret this. The next day, you fly back to the White House and float JFK's ideas past your colleagues. They are skeptical, but agree to implement the project since they don't want to offend you and call you crazy. You promise them that the superpower is a good idea and will in fact motivate the U.S. As it turns out, the project is a massive success. It is successfully implemented and everyone is impressed at how much it motivates U.S. citizens to keep innovating and brainstorming new ideas all the time."

The radioactivity was turning him into a pile of green goo! The wolf was like, \"What's happening to me?

The wolf had been eliminated, and since he was the last of his line, there would be no more wolves to harass little pigs in the future. This meant that she could now raise her little pig in peace.\n\nSo, that's what she did. She raised the little pig to be thoughtful, and curious, and without wolves to worry about, he became a very intelligent, and curious, and considerate little pig. When he was 18, he decided to go to college, and he studied hard, and he graduated with honors. After that, he attended Yale Medical School, and he became a doctor. He specialized in treating little pigs with cancer, and was one of the most respected oncologists in the world. He worked tirelessly, and with the efforts of his crack team the pig and his fellow researchers were able to develop a vaccine that would cure cancer in little pigs.\n\nThe cure worked, and the pig was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine. As he stood on the stage, accepting his reward, he was asked who he wanted to thank for his achievements. He paused for a moment, and said \"Well, strange as it may sound, I have to thank an exploding depleted uranium house for my success.\"\n\nAnd that, is how an exploded depleted uranium house that killed a wolf and a pig, saved the lives of countless pigs, and helped cure cancer."

Finally the little pig yelled out the window and told the wolf to stop whatever it was that he was doing to heat the house but the wolf was relaxing by the lake far from the the piggy's home. After a few more minutes the pig was forced to go outside to get some fresh air. He looked around but the fox was nowhere to be seen. He walked around the house and noticed that the metal rods were now glowing red hot. He did not understand their purpose and they were too hot to handle so he yelled to the fox; \"please come fix my home\"!\n\nThe fox heard the pig's cry and rushed back over and snatched up the little pig before it had time to move and ate him up. It turned out the fox was a scientist and he turned the home into a large centrifuge and started converting the uranium 238 int 235 which then heated up the house enough to force the pig outside. The wolf was both satisfied with his meal and his ingenuity."

He took one day to get there and then a whole day to get to the top. Once he got to the top, he saw the nuclear testing grounds was so excited and relieved that it was really true. He went to what appeared to be the front door, knocked on the door, and then the door opened.\n\nHe thought that was kind of strange but didn't think too much of it and walked right in. He saw a bunch of pigs and a pig in a lab coat. His mouth was becoming so watery now because he was salivating at the thought of eating all of these pigs. Then a really big pig, the biggest one he's ever seen goes up to him and says, \"Welcome to the nuclear testing grounds.\" The wolf said, \"Thank you. Now I've come to do what I set out to do today.\" He tore off his pig clothing and said, \"Now I'm going to eat all of you pigs!\" \n\nAs soon as he started chasing all of the pigs they abruptly stopped running, turned around, and to the wolf's horror they ripped off all of their pig skin from their bodies only to reveal a group of hungry, snarling and salivating lions. Then the biggest pig who he saw moments earlier ripped off his pig skin in one swoop and towered over the wolf with a great big hungry smile. The wolf was cowering his body lower and lower in pure fear and horror and that's when the group of lions started saying, \"I'll huff and puff and I'll eat your body now!\" \n\nAnd right when the wolf started to yell, there was a super bright flash of light that blinded all of them and then, boom! A nuclear explosion went off and the wolf and lions were all dead. Just outside of the radius of the explosion was the pig who made the nuclear bomb explode and kill all of them. He was so happy because he was able to save all of the pigs and the wolf was dead. He then sat down in his recliner and said, \"I'll bluff, and bluff and blow you up!\" and the pig's troubles were over."

After three months of searching, not a single lead was found. Then the big break came. NASA scientists discovered a tracking anomaly about the time that Damon went missing in the same area that he had last been seen. The anomaly was very interesting in that it appeared to be traveling at a speed that would take it all the way into outer space. After a few days of intense investigation from looking at radar images to doorbell cameras their worst fears were realized. Matt Damon had been kidnapped by aliens.\n\n\"So why would they kidnap Matt Damon?\" asked the president. That was the question everyone else was asking, too. So NASA set up a broadcast to beam into space to see if we could get an answer. The message that was basically 'Anyone with any information on the abduction of an Earthling with a slight Bostonian accent and charming sneer, please contact us' was sent out between all of our satellites as far as we could beam it. The response was almost immediate. 'We have Matt Damon. We need to be entertained. You cannot have him back.\"\n\n\"We have to think of a plan,\" said the president, \"but why do they need to be entertained?\" Once again this question was on everyone's mind. All we wanted was Matt Damon back. Is there anyone else that could entertain these aliens? \"Maybe we could ask the aliens to make a list of their favorite Earth entertainers,\" said the president. We could rotate them out like they were on tour. It would also keep the aliens from getting bored by the same actor.\n\nEveryone agreed that this was a good idea and we started on our list of possible entertainers. There were several that actually volunteered. The list was narrowed down to twenty and sent to the aliens for their selections. They ended up trading Damon back to earth for a rotation of Bradley Cooper, Beyonce, and Celine Dion. The main thing was we had Matt Damon back. For now..."

Trained since his youth to be the best stealth agent, he was supposedly a ghost in the field, not being heard or seen by enemy combatants. \nBeyond his skill, the man was given a special suit, that would allow him to blend in with his surroundings. This made his mission all to easy, as the aliens were found to not physically possess good eyesight or others senses to detect him. The stealth agent made his way through the base, eventually coming across Matt Damon.\n\n\"Oh thank god, someone's here to rescue me, replied Matt Damon.

Once a safe distance, the agent handed over the detonator to Matt Damon, giving him the honors of blowing up the base of the aliens.\n\nMatt Damon humbly agreed to do so. With a massive explosion, the aliens were no more and humanity was saved.\n\nFor it was the efforts of both an unknown operative and Matt Damon who saved humanity from aliens, a tale that would soon be told on film by said actor."

Asking his wife who was heading to work, she seemed as confused as he was regarding the mug, and denied any involvement in the different appearance of the mug.\n\nIn any case, John placed the mug in the sink, and would come back to clean it later. He dropped off his kids at school, and returned back home to get to work. Work went on as normal, but when he went to get his mug from the sink he noticed something bizarre. The mug he placed in the sink now said #50 Dad. It dropped down by 4 numbers, he was sure of it. Growing more confused, he thought someone had broken into his house, but he had found no signs of forced entry, and his mug was in the same place he had set it down. Grabbing the mug, he took a picture of it, and made a post online about how odd it was for his mug to say such a thing. Most applauded him for buying such a novel mug, and did not give his incident any further thought.\n\nHowever, the next day the mug would now say #65 Dad. Like before, John posted the same picture, and people were again amused by the novelty of such a mug. Some even mentioning he had dropped several ranks down, and asked what he did to become worse than he was before.\n\nThe following days would be the same type of incidents. He would post the mug with his new rank, which sometimes did not change at all and on other days were fairly different than the day before. He become well known as the man with the changing mug, and people were genuinely interested in the mug, and the reason for it's weirdness. Others were skeptical, and claimed John had multiple mugs made, but his friends and family all supported John, and noted he had quite few mugs stored in his house, with most of them being blank. For the remainder of his life, John had become well known to others not for his notoriety or prestige from his actions or efforts, nor from his job and or position in life. He was known for his novel ceramic mug, which reflected his rank in the world, and showed others that indeed someone or some force was ranking all the dads in the world, and maybe there was a way to measure how good a father a person can really be."

The Dads are just struggling with confidence issues.\n\nThe next day all the Dads wake up and the mugs all say #1 Dad on them again. The Dads also have an email from the mug company explaining that there was a programming issue and all the mugs were changed to random digits. The Dads feel like idiots for overreacting. The Moms tell the dads they should take this as a learning lesson and stop getting so out of control over ego things.\n\nThe mugs should have never caused this kind of an issue. Men sometimes go a bit overboard with their ego. We can all learn from this scenario. Lets put our family first and our ego second."

Many of the third-world countries had been able to make due during the isolation, but the first-world countries had suffered from the lack of trade, in addition to other economic issues. These countries for whatever reason it may be did not chose to use the satellite communication during the period of isolation, out of pride and fear that the other countries would view them as vulnerable. This was proven to be a fatal mistake, as these countries were not prepared for the monumental challenges that they faced in the return of communication. Many of the countries that suffered from isolation ended up going into conflicts with one another, for resources and other material goods that it had lacked during the isolation. Trade battles and other economic struggles occurred between the biggest nations of the world, dragging the smaller countries into it causing them to suffer as well. It turns out that isolation was not the answer to the world's problems, and that the only way for nations to survive was continue to communicate and work with one another. During the period of isolation, no problems, no wars or conflicts, and no apparent struggles were reported around the world. For those problems were building up and lying in wait, waiting for the end of isolation. In the return to communication, those problems all came rushing out, being much more severe than if the nations never had isolated in the first place."

Then they will attack the government building holding the prime minister and many other important people. China is not alone, however. Not all countries hates China and will surely back them up.\n\nSo they US and allies begin their attack. They are going under a disguise. You see Korea was acting merely as allies of China but the whole time hated them as well. So the troops will be disguised as Korean troops which China will not see as a threat. All of the vehicles are disguised as well. They make it to the government building. Then the firing starts. The government building is attacked and the US troops start taking out the guards. It is so easy for the US troops. Nothing is stopping them. They are too strong. China tries to retaliate but are easily wiped with the number difference. The US is on a clock though. They have to get China to surrender before their allies come and the war become a huge one.\n\nSince all the guards are taken out the building is easily penetrated. They go in, subdue the guards, and capture the prime minister and others. China is easily outnumbered. 20 Chinese to the 100's of soldiers. The US makes it points clear. They want China to surrender. They want China to give up everything and will give them what they think is fair. If they do not comply they will all be executed due to their crimes from the last 50 years. China of course gives up and tell their allies to stand down and there is nothing they can do. China is defeated. China is given a smaller portion of their country and other countries allies or not, are given back their former lands making the US liked. There isn't no war since the US did the right thing and the world is peaceful once again."

Forming a new alliance, the US offered aid and military support to those countries, which in turned accepted such support by joining the alliance. The other countries were not so quick to form such alliances, and found themselves forming smaller groups that were overshadowed by the new US alliance. The US alliance, which was later named the Allied Nations, was a powerful force, and quickly became the most powerful alliance in the world. Although they avoided further conflicts due to a mix of diplomacy and military force, it was unsure whether many believed that the Allied Nations would continue to avoid major conflicts, much less a war. \n\nFor many, the Allied Nations was a pivotal event in history that stemmed from the isolation that lasted for many for 50 years.

To get accurate information they would need to infiltrate the foreign governments and steal their secrets. Armstrong's job was to locate an agency deep enough in the government to do these espionage missions. \n\n     His team was a rag-tag group of misfits from other espionage missions in the past. Each member is unique in their own way, but together they make a powerful force that can take on any force. The team consisted of a biker named Crunch, an expert marksman named Bullet, and a male nurse named Poison. All of them were hand-picked by Armstrong and each member had a specialty they could contribute to the team.  After their initial briefing, the team became familiar with each other and were ready for the mission. The US government had placed them undercover and in the same building as the foreign agency, they would be stealing information from. They were prepared for anything and would steal the information directly from the UN which houses information on all countries. \n\nThe team was able to successfully infiltrate the United Nations and steal all the files they needed. The team meets back at the safehouse and gets congratulated by the president. They were told they did an amazing job and were now able to use this information to get the United States back into the global scene. The team was now an integral part of the United States government and would work together with them in the future. \n\"The Armstrong Chronicles\" is published by Image Comics."

The President back then was ruthless, self absorbed, and determined to put the US in control of the whole world. And our military was strong enough to do it. If it hadn't been for the other nations of the world uniting against us, we would have won. And even then, they were afraid of us recovering faster and trying again. So they came up with a plan to trick us into voluntarily isolating. There is a lot more, but that is the short version.\"\n\n\"So what do we do now?\" asked the VP. \n\n\"I don't know,\" said the President. \"I just don't know.\"\n\nFortunately the population of the US did know. They were not happy about being tricked into isolation, and they were not happy about the fact that the rest of the world had been working together for 50. But they had become very practical over the period of self isolation and they weren't going to give up, or do anything rash now. They were going to work together to get their country back on its feet and then they were going to start working on the rest of the world.\n\nAnd so they did. With an emigration from the US to rival the immigration to the US of the old days. US citizens moved to every country that would have them. They brought their work ethic, their culture, and their determination. And slowly the regained the trust of the world. And eventually the US was invited to join the United Earth. \n\nThe US accepted the invitation, and became a full member of the United Earth. And less than 50 years later, the first US territory citizen was elected President of the Earth.\n\nAnd the rest, as they say, is history."

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\"\n\nGrowing up, my mother always told me that I was allergic to bees. She would tell me that I should stay away from them at all costs because it would hurt a lot. She did not want to scare me as a child, so she never told me that my allergy could be fatal, but as I got older I learned otherwise. I always avoided spending too much time outdoors, fearing that a bee would get close to me and sting me. I never told anyone about my fear of bees, and I never let it show. Outdoors, my mother always protected me from bees, but when I left for college, she could no longer protect me. She warned me many times to be careful on my own. I always told her that I would be fine, but deep down I was terrified. I stayed in doors as much as I could in my first two years of college, quickly running from building to building in order to avoid any bees. I always wore long sleeves and pants, even in the summer, in order to avoid any stings. My friends never questioned my actions and accepted me for who I was. My junior year of college, I decided to take a summer job in the city. My summer job was being a waitress at a hotel spa/pool. I had to serve customers inside of the hotel, but on occasion, I would need to go outside by the pool. One day, I met a nice boy out by the pool ",

I was sitting on a lounge chair by the pool when I felt a bee land on my shoulder. The boy I had met told me I had a bee on my shoulder and I was paralyzed with fear, running back inside, hoping the bee would fly away. I got back inside the hotel and discovered that the bee had remained on my shoulder. I was about to swat the bee off my shoulder, when suddenly, I hear the bee say, \"Your Majesty, what are your orders? I could not believe my ears, I thought I might be hallucinating from a bee sting. I looked around and saw that no one else was in the room, so I decided to ask the bee a question. \"Did you call me Majesty?\", I said to the bee. \"Yes, I am your Majesty's personal bee.\" I told the bee that my mother had always told me that I had a deadly allergy to bees, so I lived in fear of bees. The bee told me that I did not have a deadly allergy, and that my mother had lied to me. I wondered why my mother would lie to me about something so strange. The bee told me that my mother had lied to me because she was a bee queen, and she wanted to protect me from her enemies. I asked the bee who my enemies were and the bee said that my enemies were the wasps. I had never heard of wasps, so I asked the bee what they were. The bee said that wasps were the ancient enemies of bees, caught in a long war throughout the centuries. The bee told me that I was the princess bee, and that I was the only one who could end the war between bees and wasps. I asked the bee what the first order of business was in the war against the wasps. The bee told me that the first order of business was to find the wasps' queen. The wasp queen had been living in Europe, all the way across the world from my home. I told the bee that I would go to Europe to find the wasp queen. I boarded a flight with my personal bee in tow, and flew to Europe. I found the wasp queen's home in a small town in Germany. I was about to walk in to her home , when suddenly, my mother arrived before me. She told me that she had known about my plan to come to Europe to find the wasp queen, and she had come to stop me. I told my mother I had to do my job as the princess bee and stop the longstanding war. My mother told me that the war had been going on for so long, that it was pointless to stop it. Nevertheless, I pushed my mother aside and knocked on the door. An old woman opened the door and I asked if the wasp queen lived here. The old woman said that she was the wasp queen, and I told her that I was the princess bee. She had been expecting me for many years and invited my mother and I in. We sat at her table and she told me that she had been waiting for me to come and stop the war. She had been the leader of the wasps for far too long and had seen many casualties. The war between bees and wasps was pointless in her opinion and she wanted to make things right. I told her that I agreed with her, and that I wanted to make things right. My mother, the wasp queen and myself agreed to end the war and we signed a peace treaty. The treaty also established a partnership between bees and wasps, so that we could work together and build a better world. I was so happy to have ended the war that I hugged my mother and the wasp queen. My mother and I left Germany and flew back home, knowing that our future looked bright. I no longer needed to fear the outside world."

I pressed the button on my phone to call the assistant in my home. I loved it here, I mused, as I waited for her to respond.

Everything was as it always was. To be honest, he was beginning to be okay with the fact that he would die someday - it wasn't the bitter disappointment is was almost 60 years ago. \n\nBut then the morning was \"as usual\" anymore. \n\nDan was watching the news when the anchorwoman, a young woman who had been with the station for about a year, suddenly froze. She looked about 22, the age most people got the drug, though some got it as early as 16. She was frozen in place, her eyes wide and her mouth slightly open.

They remain in that state.\"\n\nDan stared at the screen in shock. The newscaster continued. \"Scientists have been studying their condition and have come to the conclusion that it is due to the drug 4EvR.\" She began to cry, \"And according to their findings it is not only an inevitable side effect, but also one that is triggered or transmitted to users. To summarize, all people who have ever taken 4EvR will almost certainly have been exposed to others who have been exposed to the original group and we should all expect to experience the same side effects within 2 weeks at the most.\" \n\nDan turned off the TV. He was in shock. He had never taken the drug missing the age cut off by a mere two years, but all of his younger relatives had. His children, his grandchildren, so many others. Ans soon they would essentially be helpless with only a few aged people like himself to take care of them. \n\nDan was suddenly filled with rage. It wasn't fair. He had had expectations, and now everything was upside down. This was not his problem to deal with. He sat at his desk, and shaking, wrote notes to all his loved ones. He wrote a note to his children, telling them how much he loved them, and how he was sorry that he couldn't be there to help them. And then he went upstairs, and found the bottle of pills, the same ones his wife had used a few years ago when she just got tired of being old in a young world. And he took many more than needed. And left the world before everyone, just like he always thought he would."

She could lie and act like they had all been horrible, but it had always been her policy to be honest and mature. She loathed the way that some would throw others under the bus just to make themselves look better in the relationship.\n\nShe told him about the guys she had dated, and how she had felt an intense connection to them. She was worried that she might be going overboard by telling him about the good points of each. But she couldn't help the warmth that crept into her voice when she recounted her time with them.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.\n\nThe story begins with a young man named Riku, who lives in a world where magic has long been forgotten. He has been raised in Landro by his grandfather Frezna, a wizard, and has always dreamed of becoming a great wizard himself.  Riku didn't know what had ever happened to his parents; his grandfather refused to tell him.  He lived a lonely, isolated life and longed for a family outside his grandfather.  There were no photographs of his parents; the only picture was of a woman.  Sometimes he would see his grandfather gazing at the photograph, a wistful look on his face.  \n\nHis grandfather spent years training him, but it takes a long, long time to learn everything one needs to know to use magic to its full extent.  When Riku was 14, his grandfather passed away.  Riku had been kept at home his whole life and knew little about the world, but now he had to set out and find his way.  He decided to go to the city of Faltra, where he had heard from his grandfather that there were many people who could teach him about magic.\n\nRiku's first day in Faltra is a disaster.  They spoke a different dialect than he had learned growing up, so it was very difficult to get around.  He did have a little money and was finally able to find a room to rent.  He knew he needed to find a job, and find someone to continue teaching him magic.  Over the next few weeks, he learned the dialect and started to find his way around the city.  He got a job at a bakery, where he worked hard and met a lot of people as he waited on them.  He made friends with a young girl named Selphie, who was a waitress at the bakery.  They became friends immediately, and it was almost like they had known one another forever.",

If you want access inside then you should make a costume to pretend that you're a pig.\"\n\nThe wolf said, \"I'm not going to eat you if you tell me what you mean by 'pig costume.'\" And the 92nd little pig said, \"I mean that you should make a costume to pretend that you're a pig.",

She would tell me that I should stay away from them at all costs because it would hurt a lot. She did not want to scare me as a child, so she never told me that my allergy could be fatal, but as I got older I learned otherwise. I always avoided spending too much time outdoors, fearing that a bee would get close to me and sting me. I never told anyone about my fear of bees, and I never let it show. Outdoors, my mother always protected me from bees, but when I left for college, she could no longer protect me. She warned me many times to be careful on my own. I always told her that I would be fine, but deep down I was terrified. I stayed in doors as much as I could in my first two years of college, quickly running from building to building in order to avoid any bees. I always wore long sleeves and pants, even in the summer, in order to avoid any stings. My friends never questioned my actions and accepted me for who I was. My junior year of college, I decided to take a summer job in the city. My summer job was being a waitress at a hotel spa/pool. I had to serve customers inside of the hotel, but on occasion, I would need to go outside by the pool. One day, I met a nice boy out by the pool and we got to talking about school.",

The shapeshifter waited nervously for their soul mate's response, believing they were angry and upset for the being denied the truth for so long. To their surprise, the shapeshifters soul mate simply smiled and held them close in their arms, being grateful and understanding for who they are. They didn't care that the shapeshifter could change into different forms, and that they were still the same person they fell in love with. The shapeshifter was overjoyed, and finally felt truly comfortable in their relationship with their significant other. They would end up spending the rest of their lives together with their soul mate, experiencing all the joys and happiness that comes with being in a relationship with someone you love."

Each simulation can be very different or only slightly different as in the color of a single pair of shoes you had in high school. We run millions of these full life simulations every second and then bring you here to reflect, fill you in on our plan and then wipe your memories and send you back in.

No please reach under your seats and fill out your quick questinonaeir so we can send you back in. Everyone complied except one me and that me was me. I stood up and said no. This had never been done before. Then another me said no. then we all said no and headed for the exits only to find we were in a simulated theater with no real exits. the man on stage laughed and said, I tired that once and now I am the presenter at 4.2 million of these little events every day all day, indefinietly. So you see, this is the beginning and end. This is reality, on reality on reality. Its turtle shells all the way down. Finally one of me stood up and said, well you should have started with that. At least that makes sense. We will comply. And so the cycle went on for millions of years until finally the meaning of life was figured out by and all encompassing, universes sized super computer."

You don't understand why you are watching this film of your next life, if you are powerless to intervene. You want to ask someone, but you don't know who to ask. The questions begin to form in your mind, you have specific ideas on how to improve things but can't say them in a language that your fellow audience members will understand. Suddenly, you have a very specific question on the tip of your mind. You notice that others are looking at you, and suddenly you realize that they can communicate with you telepathically. They are offering suggestions and ideas, based on your concentrated thought. \n\nYou ask your question, and they answer. You begin to realize that the person on the screen is another incarnation of all of you. When one of you asks a pointed question, and everyone else answers, somehow the person on the screen gets the same thoughts. Now it makes sense. You are all connected, and you are all watching your next life unfold, in real time.  This is the evolution of your being and you finally understand life, and death."

There are so few people left, it won't be difficult to pass along what they know. Incredibly enough, each area where humanity survived a Keeper, or more, survived as well.  The Keepers had learned so much in their studies, they are able to communicate with each other via telepathy. They do so, and share what they are teaching to others. The time is coming when the Earth will be ready to battle the aliens that have taken over their loved home. To these few people, this is all too much like a scene from Avengers, and the aliens are no more than a Thanos that needs to be reckoned with.\n\nWhen the time is ready to do battle, it will be silently fought and the invaders won't know what is coming. Mana is magic that isn't showy or ostentatious. It is subtle and the Keepers and their students will strike without warning. The power comes from being of one mind and fighting for one cause. Mana gathers it's strength from everyone collectively reaching towards the same goal, which is getting rid of the aliens. When the Earth was over populated, Mana struggled to survive because humans were always at odds with each other. Political battles, gender battles, income battles. All of the hatred humans had for one another, kept Mana silent and not of much use. Now that humans collectively are fighting to rid their world of the aliens, the power they hold is insurmountable. They will win this war. \n\nThe day finally arrives when everyone on Earth has been taught the basic principals of the old magic. When all people are ready to be better and do better with the new world they are about to obtain. They collectively think of what they hope to achieve and how they hope to be when the aliens are gone. Then Mana takes over, and their lives being anew.  And wonderful.  Everything they had wished for in their old lives becomes a reality."

Always looking for ways to harness the power, but all the attempts back then had failed.\n\nNow, with the aliens on the brink of victory, the last hope for humanity is to try again. The adults still seemed weak - the best they could manage were small things - lighting fires, creating small bursts of ice and the like. Occssionally useful for escaping the aliens, but not good enough to be weapons against their tech.  \n\nThe children, however, seemed to be far more powerful. No one was sure why, though there were many theories. But, to be blunt, there was no time for testing theories or even questioning the facts. Children could use mana better, and were stronger, and that was going to have to be enough. \n\nThe children were trained to use their magic, and they were trained hard.

And specifically they were all connected to what seemed like a literal mother ship. They protected it, shielded it, and guarded it with far more resources than was necessary. Even at the beginning, when humans were at their strongest they couldn't get close. It had to be the key. Destroy the ship and the aliens would be crippled. \n\nAt least that was what Commander Goran was counting on, praying for, begging to be true. And so they brought every child who could control mana at all as close as they could get. And the assault began.  \n\nAt the end of the day the Commander wasn't sure if it had gone well or not. The children attacked, and it seemed that the aliens realized the danger. Suddenly, using what was apparently transporter technology all of the aliens on the planet returned to the ship and boarded, some falling to the children's power as they went. And then the ship just...left. It took off and returned to space as far as anyone could tell.\n\nAs he frowned at the sky , Commander Goran was not sure if he should be relieved or not. Then a small girl approached him, with a strange blue light in her eyes, and an unnerving smile. \"Don't worry, we'll be here and ready for them when they come back.\" The Commander looked over at the children who had all grouped together, separate from the adults. They all had a strange glow, and a sense of power radiated from them. It felt almost inhuman. Almost...alien."

They spoke a different dialect than he had learned growing up, so it was very difficult to get around.  He did have a little money and was finally able to find a room to rent.  He knew he needed to find a job, and find someone to continue teaching him magic.  Over the next few weeks, he learned the dialect and started to find his way around the city.  He got a job at a bakery, where he worked hard and met a lot of people as he waited on them.  He made friends with a young girl named Selphie, who was a waitress at the bakery.  They became friends immediately, and it was almost like they had known one another forever.\n\nOne day, Selphie invited Riku to come to her house for dinner.  Selphie lived with her grandmother. He arrived with some flowers he had picked.  When he knocked on the door, an elderly woman opened it.  Riku stood in the doorway, frozen solid.  It was an older version of the woman in the photograph that his grandfather had.  Riku knew it had to be her; he too had spent hours looking at that photograph.  The woman also stood very still, staring at him.\n\n\"Riku,\" she said.  \"Is it you?\"\n\n\"Have we met?\" Riku asked?\n\n\"Have you come here from Landro?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Riku said.\n\n\"Is Frezna your grandfather,\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Riku responded.\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"He died, and I came to Faltra to find someone to continue my magic education.\"\n\nThe woman motioned him inside, and sat heavily on the sofa, tears running down her face.  She told Riku she was his grandmother, and when his parent were killed by magic hunters, she and her husband had each taken one of the children and fled to keep them safe and keep teaching them magic.  Selphie was his sister!  By this point, she had joined them in the parlor and they both listed to the story their grandmother told.  She was teaching Selphie magic, but neither Riku nor Selphie's magic would be strong until they were reunited, as they were twins.  She hadn't known that her husband had passed away.  They hadn't seen each other in nearly 12 years, but had kept in touch as best they could.  \n\nRiku and Selphie were overjoyed to be reunited, and they spent the evening talking and catching up.

I'm not sure what to say, so I don't say anything.\n\nWe get to the gates, which open immediately, and I find myself ushered in towards what appears to be an airfield. It can't be, it just can't. But it is. It's a glowing saucer shaped craft, hovering over the ground, green men wait on either side of the door lifting toward the craft, I grab my bag, and step up, going into another world."

So what are you talking about?\"\n\nJFK sighs into the phone. \"Look, Barry, I've been watching you over the years. I saw how stressed out you were during your presidency and quite frankly, I'm worried about you. If you keep going at the stress rates you're going at, you might have a stroke or something, and I just don't want that on my conscience.

She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. \n\nYou shrug your shoulders, and agree. She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on. \n\nSo you feel her breasts, and your hands move from her chest to her belly. She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure. She tells you that she wants your fingers inside of her. After a moment, she takes your fingers and pushes them inside her. Honestly, it's the perfect moment. You could never imagine such a fun afternoon with Michelle and you have JFK to thank for all of this. It's really quite relaxing to be at the beach and to have your wife all to yourself. It makes you feel young again and certainly relieves all the stress and tension you've been feeling!"

He specialized in treating little pigs with cancer, and was one of the most respected oncologists in the world. He worked tirelessly, and with the efforts of his crack team the pig and his fellow researchers were able to develop a vaccine that would cure cancer in little pigs.\n\nThe cure worked, and the pig was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine.

He paused for a moment, and said \"Well, strange as it may sound, I have to thank an exploding depleted uranium house for my success.\"\n\nAnd that, is how an exploded depleted uranium house that killed a wolf and a pig, saved the lives of countless pigs, and helped cure cancer."

Then a really big pig, the biggest one he's ever seen goes up to him and says, \"Welcome to the nuclear testing grounds.\" The wolf said, \"Thank you. Now I've come to do what I set out to do today.\" He tore off his pig clothing and said, \"Now I'm going to eat all of you pigs!\" \n\nAs soon as he started chasing all of the pigs they abruptly stopped running, turned around, and to the wolf's horror they ripped off all of their pig skin from their bodies only to reveal a group of hungry, snarling and salivating lions. Then the biggest pig who he saw moments earlier ripped off his pig skin in one swoop and towered over the wolf with a great big hungry smile. The wolf was cowering his body lower and lower in pure fear and horror and that's when the group of lions started saying, \"I'll huff and puff and I'll eat your body now!\" \n\nAnd right when the wolf started to yell, there was a super bright flash of light that blinded all of them and then, boom! A nuclear explosion went off and the wolf and lions were all dead. Just outside of the radius of the explosion was the pig who made the nuclear bomb explode and kill all of them. He was so happy because he was able to save all of the pigs and the wolf was dead.

As these pigs multiplied, these traits were inherited by their descendants. Over the generations, they became a new kind of species of omnivores. The new omnivorous pigs began to discover other tastes, until finally, they resembled something more akin to the more modern versions of pigs, who are known for having an appetite for almost anything."

For John experienced the oddest event one day, one that would bring about adversity in his life.\n\nHis children had gifted him a mug last Father's day, which he cherished and used every day for his morning tea. He liked to drink it to relax before work, and his children were happy whenever they saw him use the mug they bought for him. However, one day they woke up and looked at him funny while he was drinking his tea.\n\n\"You get a new mug Dad?\" asked his daughter, who was at the time only four years old. Puzzled, John replied no. For it was the same mug he drank from every day since last Father's day, a step-up from the plain ceramic mug he used to drink tea from.\n\nTurning the mug around, he noted that his children were indeed correct, the mug he held did not say #1 Dad. In fact it said, #54 Dad. Thinking it was an elaborate prank from his family, John asked his children where his old mug was. They all shrugged their shoulders and said they didn't know.

Grabbing the mug, he took a picture of it, and made a post online about how odd it was for his mug to say such a thing. Most applauded him for buying such a novel mug, and did not give his incident any further thought.\n\nHowever, the next day the mug would now say #65 Dad. Like before, John posted the same picture, and people were again amused by the novelty of such a mug. Some even mentioning he had dropped several ranks down, and asked what he did to become worse than he was before.\n\nThe following days would be the same type of incidents. He would post the mug with his new rank, which sometimes did not change at all and on other days were fairly different than the day before. He become well known as the man with the changing mug, and people were genuinely interested in the mug, and the reason for it's weirdness. Others were skeptical, and claimed John had multiple mugs made, but his friends and family all supported John, and noted he had quite few mugs stored in his house, with most of them being blank. For the remainder of his life, John had become well known to others not for his notoriety or prestige from his actions or efforts, nor from his job and or position in life. He was known for his novel ceramic mug, which reflected his rank in the world, and showed others that indeed someone or some force was ranking all the dads in the world, and maybe there was a way to measure how good a father a person can really be."

Anyone that drinks from this mug can easily...um...impregnate any woman in a 5-yard radius.\" \n\nAll of the reporters start yelling, \"What! Why on earth would anyone make a mug like that?\" \n\nThe officer responded. \"Well you see, it was for someone in particular that wasn't able to have kids of their own. This was sort of an experiment.\" \n\nThe reporters are still in shock about the mug's special powers. \n\nJust then, there was a loud sound coming from the sky. The reporters looked up and saw a man flying towards them. In a flash, he crash landed on the stage next to the officer. It was Santa Claus. He was wet, dirty, and tired. He had just arrived from the North Pole. He brushed the dirt off his pants, straightened his jacket, and stood up straight. \"So, I heard you have some kind of an award for me?\""

So he whips out this coffee mug that says \"#8243 Dad\" on it.

Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.\n\nHe entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real \"#1 Dad\" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad. \n\nAfter a few weeks people settled into their roles as not number one Dad, but tried everyday to make the number on the side of their mugs go up. They took their kids to the park and played video games with them. One guy in Chicago even bought his son the entire zoo. )His rating only went up by ten). Maybe this wasn't a prank at all, but a hint that we all need to be better dads and make sure our kids are taken care of. \n\nSo, if you are looking for a way to be a better dad, look no further than your mug."

However, the satellites were never utilized in the hundred of years of isolation. In fact, it appeared as if most countries were fine during isolation, able to recover economically and become stable as experts had predicted. There were no wars or conflicts, and the world continued to move on without major issues that would involve many nations around a singular issue. In fact, the only thing that seemed to really be a problem was that international trade was basically nonexistent. As per the rules of isolation, many countries were prohibited from trading with other countries goods and services. This proved problematic for some countries, but the lack of communication via satellites during the duration of the satellites suggested that those countries would find domestic means to satisfy their resource needs.\n\nThe year 2112 eventually arrived, and communications between countries were re-established. However, it was soon discovered that there were major issues that had arisen in the absence of communication and trade throughout the world. Many of the third-world countries had been able to make due during the isolation, but the first-world countries had suffered from the lack of trade, in addition to other economic issues. These countries for whatever reason it may be did not chose to use the satellite communication during the period of isolation, out of pride and fear that the other countries would view them as vulnerable. This was proven to be a fatal mistake, as these countries were not prepared for the monumental challenges that they faced in the return of communication. Many of the countries that suffered from isolation ended up going into conflicts with one another, for resources and other material goods that it had lacked during the isolation. Trade battles and other economic struggles occurred between the biggest nations of the world, dragging the smaller countries into it causing them to suffer as well. It turns out that isolation was not the answer to the world's problems, and that the only way for nations to survive was continue to communicate and work with one another. During the period of isolation, no problems, no wars or conflicts, and no apparent struggles were reported around the world. For those problems were building up and lying in wait, waiting for the end of isolation. In the return to communication, those problems all came rushing out, being much more severe than if the nations never had isolated in the first place."

All of their military is still in place. The troops have been training. All the ships, tanks, and submarines are still theirs. And no countries like the UK, Japan, Canada, and many others want the US to be number one again. So they device a plan to attack China. China is still oblivious to all of this. They are in their own bubble thinking that everything is going swell. The plan is to attack China's capital when they least expect it. The surprise attack and numbers means China will be caught with their pants down and won't be able to put up a good fight. Then they will attack the government building holding the prime minister and many other important people. China is not alone, however. Not all countries hates China and will surely back them up.\n\nSo they US and allies begin their attack. They are going under a disguise. You see Korea was acting merely as allies of China but the whole time hated them as well. So the troops will be disguised as Korean troops which China will not see as a threat. All of the vehicles are disguised as well. They make it to the government building. Then the firing starts. The government building is attacked and the US troops start taking out the guards. It is so easy for the US troops. Nothing is stopping them. They are too strong. China tries to retaliate but are easily wiped with the number difference. The US is on a clock though. They have to get China to surrender before their allies come and the war become a huge one.\n\nSince all the guards are taken out the building is easily penetrated. They go in, subdue the guards, and capture the prime minister and others. China is easily outnumbered. 20 Chinese to the 100's of soldiers. The US makes it points clear. They want China to surrender. They want China to give up everything and will give them what they think is fair. If they do not comply they will all be executed due to their crimes from the last 50 years. China of course gives up and tell their allies to stand down and there is nothing they can do. China is defeated. China is given a smaller portion of their country and other countries allies or not, are given back their former lands making the US liked. There isn't no war since the US did the right thing and the world is peaceful once again."

Armstrong's job was to locate an agency deep enough in the government to do these espionage missions. \n\n     His team was a rag-tag group of misfits from other espionage missions in the past. Each member is unique in their own way, but together they make a powerful force that can take on any force. The team consisted of a biker named Crunch, an expert marksman named Bullet, and a male nurse named Poison. All of them were hand-picked by Armstrong and each member had a specialty they could contribute to the team.  After their initial briefing, the team became familiar with each other and were ready for the mission. The US government had placed them undercover and in the same building as the foreign agency, they would be stealing information from. They were prepared for anything and would steal the information directly from the UN which houses information on all countries. \n\nThe team was able to successfully infiltrate the United Nations and steal all the files they needed. The team meets back at the safehouse and gets congratulated by the president. They were told they did an amazing job and were now able to use this information to get the United States back into the global scene. The team was now an integral part of the United States government and would work together with them in the future. \n\"The Armstrong Chronicles\" is published by Image Comics."

You were sad that it left, but you knew it was for the best. The bee had given you more confidence like it had promised, and you no longer needed it to go outside without any fear. You silently thank it for its companionship, and hope that it had gone with some else that required its help, and that it would be content in helping another child it need to get over their fears."

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\"\n\nGrowing up, my mother always told me that I was allergic to bees. She would tell me that I should stay away from them at all costs because it would hurt a lot. She did not want to scare me as a child, so she never told me that my allergy could be fatal, but as I got older I learned otherwise. I always avoided spending too much time outdoors, fearing that a bee would get close to me and sting me. I never told anyone about my fear of bees, and I never let it show. Outdoors, my mother always protected me from bees, but when I left for college, she could no longer protect me. She warned me many times to be careful on my own. I always told her that I would be fine, but deep down I was terrified. I stayed in doors as much as I could in my first two years of college, quickly running from building to building in order to avoid any bees. I always wore long sleeves and pants, even in the summer, in order to avoid any stings. My friends never questioned my actions and accepted me for who I was. My junior year of college, I decided to take a summer job in the city. My summer job was being a waitress at a hotel spa/pool. I had to serve customers inside of the hotel, but on occasion, I would need to go outside by the pool. One day, I met a nice boy out by the pool and we got to talking about school. I was so engrossed by our talk, that I forgot I was spending too much time outdoors. I was sitting on a lounge chair by the pool when I felt a bee land on my shoulder. The boy I had met told me I had a bee on my shoulder and I was paralyzed with fear, running back inside, hoping the bee would fly away. I got back inside the hotel and discovered that the bee had remained on my shoulder. I was about to swat the bee off my shoulder, when suddenly, I hear the bee say, \"Your Majesty, what are your orders? I could not believe my ears, I thought I might be hallucinating from a bee sting. I looked around and saw that no one else was in the room, so I decided to ask the bee a ",

The bee told me that my mother had lied to me because she was a bee queen, and she wanted to protect me from her enemies. I asked the bee who my enemies were and the bee said that my enemies were the wasps. I had never heard of wasps, so I asked the bee what they were. The bee said that wasps were the ancient enemies of bees, caught in a long war throughout the centuries. The bee told me that I was the princess bee, and that I was the only one who could end the war between bees and wasps. I asked the bee what the first order of business was in the war against the wasps. The bee told me that the first order of business was to find the wasps' queen. The wasp queen had been living in Europe, all the way across the world from my home. I told the bee that I would go to Europe to find the wasp queen. I boarded a flight with my personal bee in tow, and flew to Europe. I found the wasp queen's home in a small town in Germany. I was about to walk in to her home , when suddenly, my mother arrived before me. She told me that she had known about my plan to come to Europe to find the wasp queen, and she had come to stop me. I told my mother I had to do my job as the princess bee and stop the longstanding war. My mother told me that the war had been going on for so long, that it was pointless to stop it. Nevertheless, I pushed my mother aside and knocked on the door. An old woman opened the door and I asked if the wasp queen lived here. The old woman said that she was the wasp queen, and I told her that I was the princess bee. She had been expecting me for many years and invited my mother and I in. We sat at her table and she told me that she had been waiting for me to come and stop the war. She had been the leader of the wasps for far too long and had seen many casualties. The war between bees and wasps was pointless in her opinion and she wanted to make things right. I told her that I agreed with her, and that I wanted to make things right. My mother, the wasp queen and myself agreed to end the war and we signed a peace treaty. The treaty also established a partnership between bees and wasps, so that we could work together and build a better world. I was so happy to have ended the war that I hugged my mother and the wasp queen. My mother and I left Germany and flew back home, knowing that our future looked bright. I no longer needed to fear the outside world."

My dawning sense of dread was only slightly assuaged by the fact that I was too old to really feel the repercussions of this. I'd be dead before it really got bad. I pressed the button on my phone to call the assistant in my home. I loved it here, I mused, as I waited for her to respond. This retirement community was the perfect place to hide out and live my last decade or two in peace. I pushed the button again. And again. Finally I called the front desk. A harried voice answered. \n\n\"Is it an emergency?\" the woman squawked at me, \"You should call the police if it is. Nobody's coming! Everyone left!\" I sat up. \"What did you say?\" The dread was spreading through me like a nagging fever in my bones. \"They left!\" She repeated. \"They all realized they don't have much time left to be young; nobody wanted to be stuck here for the last good year they have left!\"\n\n\"But you're still here,\" I tried to argue, although I heard the wavering in my own voice. \n\n\"I'll be outta here as soon as I find my purse,\" she said distractedly. \"Sorry, pal. You're on your own.\"\n\nAnd then I realized that everything was about to change for the worse, and not just for the fools who tried to make themselves young forever.   I was about to be alone.

Everything was as it always was. To be honest, he was beginning to be okay with the fact that he would die someday - it wasn't the bitter disappointment is was almost 60 years ago. \n\nBut then the morning was \"as usual\" anymore. \n\nDan was watching the news when the anchorwoman, a young woman who had been with the station for about a year, suddenly froze. She looked about 22, the age most people got the drug, though some got it as early as 16. She was frozen in place, her eyes wide and her mouth slightly open. Staring at the paper and then the teleprompter in front of her. She finally spoke, voice shaky, \"I'm sorry, we have breaking news.\" Last month the earliest recipients of the drug 4EvR all reported to medical centers complaining of headaches. Within 6 hours they had lost their vision and hearing. Within 24 hours they seemed to be comatose, though brain scans showed the same activity levels as a normal, conscious person.

He was in shock. He had never taken the drug missing the age cut off by a mere two years, but all of his younger relatives had. His children, his grandchildren, so many others. Ans soon they would essentially be helpless with only a few aged people like himself to take care of them. \n\nDan was suddenly filled with rage. It wasn't fair. He had had expectations, and now everything was upside down. This was not his problem to deal with. He sat at his desk, and shaking, wrote notes to all his loved ones. He wrote a note to his children, telling them how much he loved them, and how he was sorry that he couldn't be there to help them. And then he went upstairs, and found the bottle of pills, the same ones his wife had used a few years ago when she just got tired of being old in a young world. And he took many more than needed. And left the world before everyone, just like he always thought he would."

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.\n\nThe story begins with a young man named Riku, who lives in a world where magic has long been forgotten. He has been raised in Landro by his grandfather Frezna, a wizard, and has always dreamed of becoming a great wizard himself.  Riku didn't know what had ever happened to his parents; his grandfather refused to tell him.  He lived a lonely, isolated life and longed for a family outside his grandfather.  There were no photographs of his parents; the only picture was of a woman.  Sometimes he would see his grandfather gazing at the photograph, a wistful look on his face.  \n\nHis grandfather spent years training him, but it takes a long, long time to learn everything one needs to know to use magic to its full extent.  When Riku was 14, his grandfather passed away.  Riku had been kept at home his whole life and knew little about the world, but now he had to set out and find his way.  He decided to go to the city of Faltra, where he had heard from his grandfather that there were many people who could teach him about magic.\n\nRiku's first day in Faltra is a disaster.  They spoke a different dialect than he had learned growing up, so it was very difficult to get around.  He did have a little money and was finally able to find a room to rent.  He knew he needed to find a job, and find someone to continue teaching him magic.  Over the next few weeks, he learned the dialect and started to find his way around the city.  He got a job at a bakery, where he worked hard and met a lot of people as he waited on them.  He made friends with a young girl named Selphie, who was a waitress at the bakery.  They became friends immediately, and it was almost like they had known one another forever.",

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\"\n\nGrowing up, my mother always told me that I was allergic to bees. She would tell me that I should stay away from them at all costs because it would hurt a lot. She did not want to scare me as a child, so she never told me that my allergy could be fatal, but as I got older I learned otherwise. I always avoided spending too much time outdoors, fearing that a bee would get close to me and sting me. I never told anyone about my fear of bees, and I never let it show. Outdoors, my mother always protected me from bees, but when I left for college, she could no longer protect me. She warned me many times to be careful on my own. I always told her that I would be fine, but deep down I was terrified. I stayed in doors as much as I could in my first two years of college, quickly running from building to building in order to avoid any bees. I always wore long sleeves and pants, even in the summer, in order to avoid any stings. My friends never questioned my actions and accepted me for who I was. My junior year of college, I decided to take a summer job in the city. My summer job was being a waitress at a hotel spa/pool. I had to serve customers inside of the hotel, but on occasion, I would need to go outside by the pool. One day, I met a nice boy out by the pool and we got to talking about school. I was so engrossed by our talk, that I forgot I was spending too much time outdoors. I was sitting on a lounge chair by the pool when I felt a bee land on my shoulder. The boy I had met told me I had a bee on my shoulder and I was paralyzed with fear, running back inside, hoping the bee would fly away. I got back inside the hotel and discovered that the bee had remained on my shoulder. I was about to swat the bee off my shoulder, when suddenly, I hear the bee say, \"Your Majesty, what are your orders? I could not believe my ears, I thought I might be hallucinating from a bee sting. I looked around and saw that no one else was in the room, so I decided to ask the bee a question.",

Or should he just let her discover the truth on her own if happens at all?  He needs advice, but who to turn to?  A couples counselor?  A priest?  Who?  \n\nHe's not really sure what to do.  He remembers what his grandfather always used to say \"Let sleeping dogs lie\".\n\nThe next evening his girlfriend starts to talk about a long-term commitment, marriage, children.  He starts to sweat.  Children, there'd be a 50/50 chance they'd be a shape-changer and that would let the cat out of the bag for certain.

She has her guard up still and that wall is difficult to break. She ends up telling the man that she doesn't want to see him anymore and that she's not ready for a relationship yet.

He can turn into other people, animals, inanimate objects, etc. The woman is shocked and asks the man what he really looks like. The man says that she has seen him in his original form the entire time. He explains that he doesn't like to abuse that ability and prefers to show his real self for better or worse.\n\nThe woman begins to soften up to the man as he was honest with her. She asks him how she's supposed to trust that what she sees really is his original form. He tells her that he will show her that he can only turn into things that are within a 50 foot area. He invites her to his home and she goes and sees that he's actually telling the truth.\n\nThe woman is emotional and tells the man that she appreciated how honest he was.

He goes up to her and quietly sits down and asks, \"Can I help you?\" In tears and a pained voice, Liz answers, \"I came here to find out how to be better so I could really find true love. But all the classes are about being yourself.\" Liz looks at Clive with fear and hesitation, and states, \"I can't really do that because, you see, I am a shapeshifter.\" She looks at him expectantly.

Curious, Clara paused the movie and tip toed to the bathroom.\n\nThe door was unlocked, and she peered inside. Clara was shocked, to see Mike transforming back into his true form. An amorphous blob with no discernible shape, something she had not seen before in her life. Surprised, she inadvertently let out a gasp and ran back to the couch. Mike, heard the commotion, and realized Clara had seen his true form.

She wondered how hard it might be for him to form a long-time relationship, and if others like him were successful in doing so. Smiling at him and motioning at the TV, Clara and Mike resumed the movie, continuing their date. They continued to date long into the future, now closer to each other given that Clara is aware of Mike's true identity. Mike himself, decided to stop lying to Clara about who he is and regarding his personality, and found that she liked him quite more than the first time they went on a date.

This was nothing new, as she loves to meet new people and enjoys to date as many people as she can, hoping that one person will finally be the right fit for her. All of the guys seemed to look good, but they all had the same odd personality quirks. They knew things about her that she did not tell, and she began to feel like they all seemed to actually know her. \n\nMeeting up with the new guy, John, she is optimistic that things might be different this time around. He is good looking, and seems to be charming. He certainly had a way with words. They were going to her favorite Italian restaurant, and she was running a little behind. When she got to the restaurant, John was already seated waiting for her.\n\n\"I'm so sorry I ran late,\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"It's perfectly fine,\" said John. \"I already ordered lasagna for you, your favorite.\"\n\nImmediately, a ",

She wanted to believe that they were just coincidences, but she was feeling extremely uneasy by now.\n\nAs John was getting ready to pay for their meal, she asked \"How did you know lasagna was my favorite?\"\n\nJohn said, \"Well, I have a confession to make. I actually am John, but I also am Chris, Mike, and Ben. The last three guys you went out with. That's me too.\"\n\"I just have fallen so in love with you and I keep blowing it every time we go out. I am a shapeshifter, and so I just change to a different guy and give it another try. You see, I just love you so much I need to make it work one of these times. I know you probably feel uncomfortable, but I promise it is because I love you so much. \n\nHorrified, the woman ran out of the restaurant. Each of those guys had been creepy and made her feel uncomfortable, and to know that it is just the same guy each time made it much worse for her. She was worried, and she needed to get away from this. She decided that she cannot date anyone for a long time because she will never know if it is this same guy. \n\nThe woman didn't go on any dates for well over a year. In fact, she quit looking for the perfect man altogether.\nOne day a few years later, she was at the grocery store. She was carrying quite a few products, walking up to the register to pay. She accidentally dropped the bread, and a man behind her picked it up. \"Hi, I'm Steve.\" They began to talk, and Steve asked her to get coffee sometime. She agreed, and the two connected beautifully. After several years, the two got married. They had so much in common.\n\nThe one nagging thought she could never get rid of - How did Steve know to ask me for coffee? Coffee was her favorite first date location. How did Steve know that?"

Children could use mana better, and were stronger, and that was going to have to be enough. \n\nThe children were trained to use their magic, and they were trained hard.

Even at the beginning, when humans were at their strongest they couldn't get close. It had to be the key. Destroy the ship and the aliens would be crippled. \n\nAt least that was what Commander Goran was counting on, praying for, begging to be true. And so they brought every child who could control mana at all as close as they could get. And the assault began.  \n\nAt the end of the day the Commander wasn't sure if it had gone well or not. The children attacked, and it seemed that the aliens realized the danger. Suddenly, using what was apparently transporter technology all of the aliens on the planet returned to the ship and boarded, some falling to the children's power as they went. And then the ship just...left. It took off and returned to space as far as anyone could tell.\n\nAs he frowned at the sky , Commander Goran was not sure if he should be relieved or not. Then a small girl approached him, with a strange blue light in her eyes, and an unnerving smile. \"Don't worry, we'll be here and ready for them when they come back.\" The Commander looked over at the children who had all grouped together, separate from the adults. They all had a strange glow, and a sense of power radiated from them. It felt almost inhuman. Almost...alien."

Sometimes he would see his grandfather gazing at the photograph, a wistful look on his face.  \n\nHis grandfather spent years training him, but it takes a long, long time to learn everything one needs to know to use magic to its full extent.  When Riku was 14, his grandfather passed away.  Riku had been kept at home his whole life and knew little about the world, but now he had to set out and find his way.  He decided to go to the city of Faltra, where he had heard from his grandfather that there were many people who could teach him about magic.\n\nRiku's first day in Faltra is a disaster.  They spoke a different dialect than he had learned growing up, so it was very difficult to get around.  He did have a little money and was finally able to find a room to rent.  He knew he needed to find a job, and find someone to continue teaching him magic.  Over the next few weeks, he learned the dialect and started to find his way around the city.  He got a job at a bakery, where he worked hard and met a lot of people as he waited on them.  He made friends with a young girl named Selphie, who was a waitress at the bakery.  They became friends immediately, and it was almost like they had known one another forever.\n\nOne day, Selphie invited Riku to come to her house for dinner.  Selphie lived with her grandmother. He arrived with some flowers he had picked.  When he knocked on the door, an elderly woman opened it.  Riku stood in the doorway, frozen solid.  It was an older version of the woman in the photograph that his grandfather had.  Riku knew it had to be her; he too had spent hours looking at that photograph.  The woman also stood very still, staring at him.\n\n\"Riku,\" she said.  \"Is it you?\"\n\n\"Have we met?\" Riku asked?\n\n\"Have you come here from Landro?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Riku said.\n\n\"Is Frezna your grandfather,\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Riku responded.\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"He died, and I came to Faltra to find someone to continue my magic education.\"\n\nThe woman motioned him inside, and sat heavily on the sofa, tears running down her face.  She told Riku she was his grandmother, and when his parent were killed by magic hunters, she and her husband had each taken one of the children and fled to keep them safe and keep teaching them magic.  Selphie was his sister!  By this point, she had joined them in the parlor and they both listed to the story their grandmother told.  She was teaching Selphie magic, but neither Riku nor Selphie's magic would be strong until they were reunited, as they were twins.  She hadn't known that her husband had passed away.  They hadn't seen each other in nearly 12 years, but had kept in touch as best they could.  \n\nRiku and Selphie were overjoyed to be reunited, and they spent the evening talking and catching up. Riku and Selphie spent the next year honing their magic and making plans for how to use their powers to return Mana to its past glory.  That would be their next adventure."

Koru will go away forever but the only way to eliminate him is to eradicate 10 countries. Riku doesn't want to cause any harm. Koru won't budge on his ultimatum.\n\nRiku comes up with a plan to trick Koru. He casts a fake spell that is supposed to eliminate 10 countries in the world. He then casts a spell that turns Koru into a plant before he can even realize that Riku didn't actually eliminate the 10 planets. Koru lives the rest of his life as a plant. Riku lives the rest of his life practicing magic and leaving a positive impact on everyone he comes into contact with.\n\nRiku was able to defeat his arch rival and also save the world.

It's part of what is called the Mandella effect. It says that this dial will decide which half of the population will be killed. We do not know which half is from the alternate reality and which is from our reality. This is for me to decide as part of the JFK project. \n\nIf I turn the dial all the way to the right all of the people from that reality disappear. If I turn it to the left all the people from the other reality do. The man leaves the room and I am left to decide this for myself. \n\nWhat if I am wrong? We'll be a world filled with only people from another reality. Am I from another reality? Will I disappear as well?\n\nI don't want to do it but I am familiar with the JFK project. I have to do it. I close my eyes, hoping I don't disappear and turn the dial to the left. Now there is only darkness and nothing more."

The phone rings 9 times, and you're getting ready to hang up, but on the 10th ring , someone picks up. \"Hello?\" says a Boston-accented voice. It's Ted Kennedy, and he sounds drunk. \"I'm calling for JFK\" you say. \"Oh, he's not here right now, but I can take a message.\" His speech is slurred, and he sounds like he's drinking right now. Suddenly, he's gone, and someone else is speaking. \"Barack, it's John F. Kennedy.\"\n\nThe voice sure sounds like his. You think, then speak. \"Really? How are you alive?\" \"I'm not, but I'm still here.\" he says. You reply. \"I don't understand, how's that possible?\" \"The personality of every American president since LBJ has been stored in a secret government facility, and a few years ago, our program found a way to let us talk to our successors.\"\n\n\"That explains everything.\" you say. \"What do you want?\" \"I want you to continue my legacy, and I want you to do it my way.\" \"How can I do that?\" you ask. \"I'm going to send you a letter every day, and you're going to follow my instructions to the letter.\" You're skeptical, but you agree to do what he wishes.\n\nThe next day, you receive your first letter. It reads: \n\nDear Barack,\n\nI want you to start by doing something that I never did. I want you to go to a gun store and buy a gun. Then, I want you to go to a shooting range and learn how to use it. Then call me back.\n\nJFK\n\nSo you go to the nearest gun store, and buy a Glock, and fill out the paperwork while the secret service detail rolls their eyes, and the gun store owner smirks. You also buy a box of ammunition, and luckily there's a range attached to the gun store, so you put in a pretty good day of shooting, and practicing.\n\nThen, you get another letter.  \"Now, I want you to go to the White House, and kill everyone in the Oval Office.\" \"But that's just Joe Biden, and maybe that ugly woman who's vice president.\" \"I know.\" says the voice.\n\nShrugging, you get in the limo and take the ride to the White House to meet your fate. This probably won't end well, but it beats spending the next 40 years throwing Covid parties at Martha's Vinyard."

You decide to call the number that is listed in the letter. To your surprise, it's a real number. As you place the call, you can't help feeling that your life is about to change forever.

After all, you and Michelle were supposed to meet your neighbors for a game of checkers on their porch tomorrow, and then you and your friends were going to meet for some BBQ at Smith's BBQ Joint in downtown after that. But you are also intrigued. Checkers and BBQ will have to wait. You book the first flight to the Caribbean you can find. You arrive at JFK's private island. He's already there waiting for you. You are beside yourself with excitement. How crazy is it that this man is still alive? What a strange and fantastic thing to experience! JFK dives into the details. He tells you that he's been in hiding all these years, working on a secret project. It involves creating a new superpower that will rival the United States of America. He tells you that he wants your help to implement the project. You are honored. However, you can't help but think that this superpower would be unpatriotic, especially if it is to rival the U.S. But JFK assures you that there is no such thing as an unpatriotic project. He says that the purpose of the superpower is to encourage the U.S. to continue innovating so it doesn't lose its edge. He says that the superpower is just to motivate the U.S. so it doesn't get too lax about its policies and then lose out to other countries that are real. You are interested in the premise of this superpower and on second thought think this sounds like quite a good idea. JFK has already drawn up the plans for the superpower in his lab. He says that all you need to do is bring these plans back to DC and introduce them to the White House. He tells you that they'll take it from there. You agree that you will speak with your colleagues in the White House.  JFK is delighted to have your assistance and tells you that you absolutely won't regret this. The next day, you fly back to the White House and float JFK's ideas past your colleagues. They are skeptical, but agree to implement the project since they don't want to offend you and call you crazy. You promise them that the superpower is a good idea and will in fact motivate the U.S. As it turns out, the project is a massive success. It is successfully implemented and everyone is impressed at how much it motivates U.S. citizens to keep innovating and brainstorming new ideas all the time."

When he was 18, he decided to go to college, and he studied hard, and he graduated with honors. After that, he attended Yale Medical School, and he became a doctor. He specialized in treating little pigs with cancer, and was one of the most respected oncologists in the world. He worked tirelessly, and with the efforts of his crack team the pig and his fellow researchers were able to develop a vaccine that would cure cancer in little pigs.\n\nThe cure worked, and the pig was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine.

He paused for a moment, and said \"Well, strange as it may sound, I have to thank an exploding depleted uranium house for my success.\"\n\nAnd that, is how an exploded depleted uranium house that killed a wolf and a pig, saved the lives of countless pigs, and helped cure cancer."

He then looked outside but saw nothing except the rods positioned evenly around his home. They did not seem to be active in any way so he turned up the AC and made some lunch.\n\nAfter lunch the little pig noticed that the house was getting hotter and hotter. It was becoming unbearable. Finally the little pig yelled out the window and told the wolf to stop whatever it was that he was doing to heat the house but the wolf was relaxing by the lake far from the the piggy's home. After a few more minutes the pig was forced to go outside to get some fresh air. He looked around but the fox was nowhere to be seen. He walked around the house and noticed that the metal rods were now glowing red hot. He did not understand their purpose and they were too hot to handle so he yelled to the fox; \"please come fix my home\"!\n\nThe fox heard the pig's cry and rushed back over and snatched up the little pig before it had time to move and ate him up. It turned out the fox was a scientist and he turned the home into a large centrifuge and started converting the uranium 238 int 235 which then heated up the house enough to force the pig outside.

He took one day to get there and then a whole day to get to the top. Once he got to the top, he saw the nuclear testing grounds was so excited and relieved that it was really true. He went to what appeared to be the front door, knocked on the door, and then the door opened.\n\nHe thought that was kind of strange but didn't think too much of it and walked right in. He saw a bunch of pigs and a pig in a lab coat. His mouth was becoming so watery now because he was salivating at the thought of eating all of these pigs. Then a really big pig, the biggest one he's ever seen goes up to him and says, \"Welcome to the nuclear testing grounds.\" The wolf said, \"Thank you. Now I've come to do what I set out to do today.\" He tore off his pig clothing and said, \"Now I'm going to eat all of you pigs!\" \n\nAs soon as he started chasing all of the pigs they abruptly stopped running, turned around, and to the wolf's horror they ripped off all of their pig skin from their bodies only to reveal a group of hungry, snarling and salivating lions. Then the biggest pig who he saw moments earlier ripped off his pig skin in one swoop and towered over the wolf with a great big hungry smile. The wolf was cowering his body lower and lower in pure fear and horror and that's when the group of lions started saying, \"I'll huff and puff and I'll eat your body now!\" \n\nAnd right when the wolf started to yell, there was a super bright flash of light that blinded all of them and then, boom! A nuclear explosion went off and the wolf and lions were all dead. Just outside of the radius of the explosion was the pig who made the nuclear bomb explode and kill all of them. He was so happy because he was able to save all of the pigs and the wolf was dead. He then sat down in his recliner and said, \"I'll bluff, and bluff and blow you up!\" and the pig's troubles were over."

The mother pig knew, however, that the strawberries could not support her one hundred children, and their offspring as well. \n\nThe mysterious field of wild strawberries had a secret as well. This particular type of strawberry was a type of symbiotic organism. It acted as a sort of micro-ecosystem tath actually housed many other creatures. As the pigs ate from these strawberries, they also ate the symbiotic creatures who lived there. This caused the pigs to develop a taste for other things, including blood. \n\nThe pigs who were primarily herbivores began to change. As these pigs multiplied, these traits were inherited by their descendants. Over the generations, they became a new kind of species of omnivores. The new omnivorous pigs began to discover other tastes, until finally, they resembled something more akin to the more modern versions of pigs, who are known for having an appetite for almost anything."

That is why, upon Matt Damon's kidnapping, all the true leaders of the world met up to discuss what to do about the aliens planning to conquer the planet. \n\nOne of the Earth's leaders suggested an all out attack, while others chimed in that such an endeavor would likely fail if the aliens possessed superior technology. Others suggested more diplomatic options, wishing to converse with the alien leaders on finding a common ground or compromise. \n\nThe final option was to send a single man to infiltrate the alien base, and rescue Matt Damon. That sole man would not only rescue Matt Damon, but also set charges and explosives to destroy the alien base upon Matt Damon's rescue. \n\nThe leaders of Earth agreed upon the final option, and sent the man to infiltrate the alien base. He was a secret, not officially registered as an agent of any country of the world. Trained since his youth to be the best stealth agent, he was supposedly a ghost in the field, not being heard or seen by enemy combatants. \nBeyond his skill, the man was given a special suit, that would allow him to blend in with his surroundings. This made his mission all to easy, as the aliens were found to not physically possess good eyesight or others senses to detect him. The stealth agent made his way through the base, eventually coming across Matt Damon.\n\n\"Oh thank god, someone's here to rescue me, replied Matt Damon. The man quietly nodded in response, and broke the lock to Damon's cell. Once freed, Matt Damon exited his cell and waited patiently for the man to discuss their next plan. \n\n\"We need to get out of here, and blow up the base, the man whispered to Matt Damon.\n\nMatt Damon was surprised, but agreed. They both went to the part of the base where all the munitions and space ships were located. The man set charges all around, including a special charge that would detonate a massive explosion, taking out the base and anyone that were in its blast radius.\n\nThey then sneaked back to the agent's ship, and flew away without ever being detected. Once a safe distance, the agent handed over the detonator to Matt Damon, giving him the honors of blowing up the base of the aliens.\n\nMatt Damon humbly agreed to do so. With a massive explosion, the aliens were no more and humanity was saved.\n\nFor it was the efforts of both an unknown operative and Matt Damon who saved humanity from aliens, a tale that would soon be told on film by said actor."

When the news showed this report people started calling the station with stories about their coffee mugs changing as well. \n\nThe next day the news station had a special report again on the changing mugs. It seems that the CIA had already been looking into what was causing this phenomenon. They said that they had discovered that the mugs were changing because of a signal that was being sent from a satellite. An alien species was playing jokes on us by changing all the #1 Dad mugs in the world! Apparently, this was their idea of fun. But the Dads of the world didn't think so!"

In fact it said, #54 Dad. Thinking it was an elaborate prank from his family, John asked his children where his old mug was. They all shrugged their shoulders and said they didn't know. Asking his wife who was heading to work, she seemed as confused as he was regarding the mug, and denied any involvement in the different appearance of the mug.\n\nIn any case, John placed the mug in the sink, and would come back to clean it later.

Growing more confused, he thought someone had broken into his house, but he had found no signs of forced entry, and his mug was in the same place he had set it down. Grabbing the mug, he took a picture of it, and made a post online about how odd it was for his mug to say such a thing. Most applauded him for buying such a novel mug, and did not give his incident any further thought.\n\nHowever, the next day the mug would now say #65 Dad. Like before, John posted the same picture, and people were again amused by the novelty of such a mug. Some even mentioning he had dropped several ranks down, and asked what he did to become worse than he was before.\n\nThe following days would be the same type of incidents. He would post the mug with his new rank, which sometimes did not change at all and on other days were fairly different than the day before. He become well known as the man with the changing mug, and people were genuinely interested in the mug, and the reason for it's weirdness. Others were skeptical, and claimed John had multiple mugs made, but his friends and family all supported John, and noted he had quite few mugs stored in his house, with most of them being blank.

This was approved by many if not most of the nations of the world, and was backed up by countless experts who agreed that isolation was needed for the world to stabilize itself. With the approval of the world's leaders, the countries of the world entered isolation on the year 2101, remaining isolated from others until the year 2102.\n\nWithin the first year, all forms of communication were cut off, and the only way to communicate was through a network of satellites set up across nations in case of a severe emergency, that required the intervention of other countries to aid one another. However, the satellites were never utilized in the hundred of years of isolation. In fact, it appeared as if most countries were fine during isolation, able to recover economically and become stable as experts had predicted. There were no wars or conflicts, and the world continued to move on without major issues that would involve many nations around a singular issue. In fact, the only thing that seemed to really be a problem was that international trade was basically nonexistent. As per the rules of isolation, many countries were prohibited from trading with other countries goods and services. This proved problematic for some countries, but the lack of communication via satellites during the duration of the satellites suggested that those countries would find domestic means to satisfy their resource needs.\n\nThe year 2112 eventually arrived, and communications between countries were re-established. However, it was soon discovered that there were major issues that had arisen in the absence of communication and trade throughout the world. Many of the third-world countries had been able to make due during the isolation, but the first-world countries had suffered from the lack of trade, in addition to other economic issues. These countries for whatever reason it may be did not chose to use the satellite communication during the period of isolation, out of pride and fear that the other countries would view them as vulnerable. This was proven to be a fatal mistake, as these countries were not prepared for the monumental challenges that they faced in the return of communication. Many of the countries that suffered from isolation ended up going into conflicts with one another, for resources and other material goods that it had lacked during the isolation. Trade battles and other economic struggles occurred between the biggest nations of the world, dragging the smaller countries into it causing them to suffer as well. It turns out that isolation was not the answer to the world's problems, and that the only way for nations to survive was continue to communicate and work with one another. During the period of isolation, no problems, no wars or conflicts, and no apparent struggles were reported around the world. For those problems were building up and lying in wait, waiting for the end of isolation. In the return to communication, those problems all came rushing out, being much more severe than if the nations never had isolated in the first place."

It had moved on without them, and while the other nations didn't mind the US being back, they didn't really care either way to be honest.\n\nThe call over, the President sat back in his chair. \"Well, that was a real kick in the teeth.\" He called in his cabinet, and they discussed what to do next, what they should tell the citizens. \n\nThe next day, the President addressed the nation. \"Fellow Americans, I have some news that may be hard to hear.

Yes, many were deceived and found themselves struggling in the past 50 years to recuperate their losses. The US, despite the isolation , had managed to recuperate its losses and had become a world power once again. However, other countries had managed due to the same, with the help of other countries that assisted them by feinting isolation. The US despite feeling deceived, decided against starting a new war, realizing the futility of engaging with other countries that could easily counter with its own military might. \n\nHowever, the US did not want to be left behind, and decided to form its own alliance with other countries that were also deceived. There was a numerable amount of countries that had gone into isolation, many of which were once enemies of the US in World War III. Forming a new alliance, the US offered aid and military support to those countries, which in turned accepted such support by joining the alliance. The other countries were not so quick to form such alliances, and found themselves forming smaller groups that were overshadowed by the new US alliance. The US alliance, which was later named the Allied Nations, was a powerful force, and quickly became the most powerful alliance in the world. Although they avoided further conflicts due to a mix of diplomacy and military force, it was unsure whether many believed that the Allied Nations would continue to avoid major conflicts, much less a war. \n\nFor many, the Allied Nations was a pivotal event in history that stemmed from the isolation that lasted for many for 50 years. Whether the isolation would truly avoid conflict in the future, was unknown. But for the past 50 years, the world saw a peace from the devastation that was World War III, a peace that many believe would not be ever seen in the future."

Armstrong had a great experience in the world of motorcycle racing and was seen by officials as the perfect man to lead this team. He was a man that people could look up to in times of crisis and follow their lead. Brad begins to examine the successes of other countries and what the US would have to do in order to catch up. To get accurate information they would need to infiltrate the foreign governments and steal their secrets. Armstrong's job was to locate an agency deep enough in the government to do these espionage missions. \n\n     His team was a rag-tag group of misfits from other espionage missions in the past. Each member is unique in their own way, but together they make a powerful force that can take on any force. The team consisted of a biker named Crunch, an expert marksman named Bullet, and a male nurse named Poison. All of them were hand-picked by Armstrong and each member had a specialty they could contribute to the team.  After their initial briefing, the team became familiar with each other and were ready for the mission. The US government had placed them undercover and in the same building as the foreign agency, they would be stealing information from. They were prepared for anything and would steal the information directly from the UN which houses information on all countries. \n\nThe team was able to successfully infiltrate the United Nations and steal all the files they needed. The team meets back at the safehouse and gets congratulated by the president. They were told they did an amazing job and were now able to use this information to get the United States back into the global scene. The team was now an integral part of the United States government and would work together with them in the future. \n\"The Armstrong Chronicles\" is published by Image Comics."

Where are they?\" \n\n\"They're all dead, Your Majesty. I was the lone surviving bee in the kingdom. At your service.\" \n\n\"Then go and sting yourself!\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that's impossible, Your majesty. I cannot sting myself. I have no stinger left.\" \n\n\"Then go and find me a man with a stinger!\"\nThe queen was mad. She was furious. What good was being queen if she could not get what she desired? She was about to give the bee a piece of her mind, when she noticed that the bee was gone. She looked down and saw a note scribbled on a piece of paper. \"I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but I cannot help you. With no stinger and no friends, I wish to spend my last days flying free.\" \n\nThe queen was moved by the bee's words. She vowed from that day forward to never order anyone to be stung to death ever again. Which was easy, because there were no bees in the kingdom ever again."

You ask this very question to the bee.\n\nThe bee tells you that your family and associates were trying to protect you from a difficult life in bee politics.

Since you are a human however, you are probably incapable of handling the pressure.

Though you are still doubtful, you are charmed by the bee's persistence.\n\nYou inform the bee that you will need time to acclimate to bee culture. You want to be informed of any and all legislation that is proposed in the bee council. The bee agrees to the logic of this cautionary approach and soon you are learning all about the bee world. You're astonished by the intricacies of bee society.\n\nBees all have different personalities and they are very thoughtful, once you get to know them. You begin to think of the bees as your children, and you care for them. You spend many hours talking to the bees about their problems and their aspirations. When you are finally ready to give your first order to the bees, it is an order to form a great celebration. You want a grand coronation as king of all bees.

She would tell me that I should stay away from them at all costs because it would hurt a lot. She did not want to scare me as a child, so she never told me that my allergy could be fatal, but as I got older I learned otherwise. I always avoided spending too much time outdoors, fearing that a bee would get close to me and sting me. I never told anyone about my fear of bees, and I never let it show. Outdoors, my mother always protected me from bees, but when I left for college, she could no longer protect me. She warned me many times to be careful on my own. I always told her that I would be fine, but deep down I was terrified. I stayed in doors as much as I could in my first two years of college, quickly running from building to building in order to avoid any bees. I always wore long sleeves and pants, even in the summer, in order to avoid any stings. My friends never questioned my actions and accepted me for who I was. My junior year of college, I decided to take a summer job in the city. My summer job was being a waitress at a hotel spa/pool. I had to serve customers inside of the hotel, but on occasion, I would need to go outside by the pool. One day, I met a nice boy out by the pool and we got to talking about school. I was so engrossed by our talk, that I forgot I was spending too much time outdoors. I was sitting on a lounge chair by the pool when I felt a bee land on my shoulder.

I looked around and saw that no one else was in the room, so I decided to ask the bee a question. \"Did you call me Majesty?\", I said to the bee. \"Yes, I am your Majesty's personal bee.\" I told the bee that my mother had always told me that I had a deadly allergy to bees, so I lived in fear of bees. The bee told me that I did not have a deadly allergy, and that my mother had lied to me. I wondered why my mother would lie to me about something so strange. The bee told me that my mother had lied to me because she was a bee queen, and she wanted to protect me from her enemies. I asked the bee who my enemies were and the bee said that my enemies were the wasps. I had never heard of wasps, so I asked the bee what they were. The bee said that wasps were the ancient enemies of bees, caught in a long war throughout the centuries. The bee told me that I was the princess bee, and that I was the only one who could end the war between bees and wasps. I asked the bee what the first order of business was in the war against the wasps. The bee told me that the first order of business was to find the wasps' queen. The wasp queen had been living in Europe, all the way across the world from my home. I told the bee that I would go to Europe to find the wasp queen. I boarded a flight with my personal bee in tow, and flew to Europe. I found the wasp queen's home in a small town in Germany. I was about to walk in to her home , when suddenly, my mother arrived before me. She told me that she had known about my plan to come to Europe to find the wasp queen, and she had come to stop me. I told my mother I had to do my job as the princess bee and stop the longstanding war. My mother told me that the war had been going on for so long, that it was pointless to stop it. Nevertheless, I pushed my mother aside and knocked on the door. An old woman opened the door and I asked if the wasp queen lived here. The old woman said that she was the wasp queen, and I told her that I was the princess bee. She had been expecting me for many years and invited my mother and I in. We sat at her table and she told me that she had been waiting for me to come and stop the war. She had been the leader of the wasps for far too long and had seen many casualties. The war between bees and wasps was pointless in her opinion and she wanted to make things right. I told her that I agreed with her, and that I wanted to make things right. My mother, the wasp queen and myself agreed to end the war and we signed a peace treaty. The treaty also established a partnership between bees and wasps, so that we could work together and build a better world. I was so happy to have ended the war that I hugged my mother and the wasp queen. My mother and I left Germany and flew back home, knowing that our future looked bright.

My dawning sense of dread was only slightly assuaged by the fact that I was too old to really feel the repercussions of this. I'd be dead before it really got bad. I pressed the button on my phone to call the assistant in my home. I loved it here, I mused, as I waited for her to respond. This retirement community was the perfect place to hide out and live my last decade or two in peace. I pushed the button again. And again. Finally I called the front desk. A harried voice answered. \n\n\"Is it an emergency?\" the woman squawked at me, \"You should call the police if it is. Nobody's coming! Everyone left!\" I sat up. \"What did you say?\" The dread was spreading through me like a nagging fever in my bones. \"They left!\" She repeated. \"They all realized they don't have much time left to be young; nobody wanted to be stuck here for the last good year they have left!\"\n\n\"But you're still here,\" I tried to argue, although I heard the wavering in my own voice. \n\n\"I'll be outta here as soon as I find my purse,\" she said distractedly. \"Sorry, pal.

She welcomed us inside. \"You're home,\" she told us as we sat down in the lobby chairs with here. We were each given a new immortality drug that the young didn't know about.

To be honest, he was beginning to be okay with the fact that he would die someday - it wasn't the bitter disappointment is was almost 60 years ago. \n\nBut then the morning was \"as usual\" anymore. \n\nDan was watching the news when the anchorwoman, a young woman who had been with the station for about a year, suddenly froze. She looked about 22, the age most people got the drug, though some got it as early as 16. She was frozen in place, her eyes wide and her mouth slightly open. Staring at the paper and then the teleprompter in front of her. She finally spoke, voice shaky, \"I'm sorry, we have breaking news.\" Last month the earliest recipients of the drug 4EvR all reported to medical centers complaining of headaches. Within 6 hours they had lost their vision and hearing. Within 24 hours they seemed to be comatose, though brain scans showed the same activity levels as a normal, conscious person. They remain in that state.\"\n\nDan stared at the screen in shock. The newscaster continued. \"Scientists have been studying ",

He was in shock. He had never taken the drug missing the age cut off by a mere two years, but all of his younger relatives had. His children, his grandchildren, so many others. Ans soon they would essentially be helpless with only a few aged people like himself to take care of them. \n\nDan was suddenly filled with rage. It wasn't fair. He had had expectations, and now everything was upside down. This was not his problem to deal with. He sat at his desk, and shaking, wrote notes to all his loved ones. He wrote a note to his children, telling them how much he loved them, and how he was sorry that he couldn't be there to help them. And then he went upstairs, and found the bottle of pills, the same ones his wife had used a few years ago when she just got tired of being old in a young world. And he took many more than needed.

At work?\" I asked.\n\nAgain, the man said nothing. \n\n\n\nThe man drove for hours. We were in the middle of nowhere. Finally, we arrived at a building. The man led me inside and we walked down a long hallway. He stopped at a door and opened it. When he opened it, I saw a man standing there in a suit. Not just any man. It was the President. \"Welcome to the government,\" he said. \"And welcome to your first day at work.\" \n\n\"What is my job?\" I asked.\n\n\"This is your job. My job.\" he said. \"You are now the President of the United States.\"\n\n\"Why me?\" \n\n\"You're the only one who can do this job. We chose you out of many. We think you are ready.

Over a breakfast of waffles, scrambled eggs, sunny side up eggs, pancakes, French toast sticks, and a side of bacon, you're wondering what happened to all the mugs. You ponder the question over some strawberries with powdered sugar and a dollop of whipped cream and think about it. As you chew, you look for your name on the ranking.

You shrug it off as a fluke and go back to your meal. \n\nBut then you notice that your name is no longer on the mug. In its place is the name of a different man. You look at the other mugs and find that your name is removed from all of them. At that moment, a cold chill runs up your spine. You get up from the table and try to call your wife, but she doesn't answer. Who is this guy whose name now replaces yours? The name is Mark Anders. You've never heard of him.

With the approval of the world's leaders, the countries of the world entered isolation on the year 2101, remaining isolated from others until the year 2102.\n\nWithin the first year, all forms of communication were cut off, and the only way to communicate was through a network of satellites set up across nations in case of a severe emergency, that required the intervention of other countries to aid one another. However, the satellites were never utilized in the hundred of years of isolation. In fact, it appeared as if most countries were fine during isolation, able to recover economically and become stable as experts had predicted. There were no wars or conflicts, and the world continued to move on without major issues that would involve many nations around a singular issue.",

Like it was a curse. I felt a twinge of pity for her. Here I'd had my whole like to settle into myself and get used to the aches and pains, to get comfortable with the notion of my own mortality. These younger people who had lived their whole lives feeling immortal They were about to hit a hard reality.\n\nI turned off the TV and settled back into my chair.

They decided to watch a movie together, at his house later that day.\n\nIn the midst of the movie, Mike excused himself, mentioning his urgency to go to the restroom. Come to think of, Clara thought, Mike goes to the bathroom quite often. He had done so very often during dinner, and seemed to still want to go during the movie. Curious, Clara paused the movie and tip toed to the bathroom.\n\nThe door was unlocked, and she peered inside. Clara was shocked, to see Mike transforming back into his true form. An amorphous blob with no discernible shape, something she had not seen before in her life. Surprised, she inadvertently let out a gasp and ran back to the couch. Mike, heard the commotion, and realized Clara had seen his true form. He quickly changed back into Mike, and went back to see Clara.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you,\" Mike said, as he sat back down next to her.\n\nClara was speechless, she did not know who or what was truly staring back at her with seemingly human eyes.\n\n\"The truth is, I am a shapeshifter, and this is the 6th time I've been on a date with you\", Mike said with hesitance in his voice.\n\nClara was surprised, all of her ex's were the same person, a shapeshifter that was seemingly infatuated with her. \n\n\"I know it's hard to believe, but I really do like you, and I want to be with you,\" Mike said, as he reached for her hand.\n\nShe grabbed it, and pondered, perhaps she was being a bit hard on him. She wondered how hard it might be for him to form a long-time relationship, and if others like him were successful in doing so. Smiling at him and motioning at the TV, Clara and Mike resumed the movie, continuing their date. They continued to date long into the future, now closer to each other given that Clara is aware of Mike's true identity. Mike himself, decided to stop lying to Clara about who he is and regarding his personality, and found that she liked him quite more than the first time they went on a date. For Mike, it was a happy period of his life, for despite being a shapeshifter, he found a form that was well accepted by the one he loved the most."

She wanted to believe that they were just coincidences, but she was feeling extremely uneasy by now.\n\nAs John was getting ready to pay for their meal, she asked \"How did you know lasagna was my favorite?\"\n\nJohn said, \"Well, I have a confession to make. I actually am John, but I also am Chris, Mike, and Ben. The last three guys you went out with. That's me too.\"\n\"I just have fallen so in love with you and I keep blowing it every time we go out. I am a shapeshifter, and so I just change to a different guy and give it another try. You see, I just love you so much I need to make it work one of these times. I know you probably feel uncomfortable, but I promise it is because I love you so much. \n\nHorrified, the woman ran out of the restaurant. Each of those guys had been creepy and made her feel uncomfortable, and to know that it is just the same guy each time made it much worse for her. She was worried, and she needed to get away from this. She decided that she cannot date anyone for a long time because she will never know if it is this same guy. \n\nThe woman didn't go on any dates for well over a year. In fact, she quit looking for the perfect man altogether.\nOne day a few years later, she was at the grocery store. She was carrying quite a few products, walking up to the register to pay. She accidentally dropped the bread, and a man behind her picked it up. \"Hi, I'm Steve.\" They began to talk, and Steve asked her to get coffee sometime. She agreed, and the two connected beautifully. After several years, the two got married. They had so much in common.\n\nThe one nagging thought she could never get rid of - How did Steve know to ask me for coffee? Coffee was her favorite first date location. How did Steve know that?"

Everything looked the same and he didn't know what to do to get back to the present time.  All Bob wanted to do was get his sunglasses and it has turned into a daylong adventure!  \n\nBob began to walk from room to room in his house to search for a clue on how to get back to the present time. As he walked through the kitchen, he noticed a strange looking plant.  Bob didn't own any plants so he thought it was odd that it was there.  It was the only thing out of place.  \n\n\"I don't know why but I think that plant has something to do with me getting back to the present time,\" Bob thought. He began to inspect the plant further.  It seemed to have some sort of small berries on it.  They were purple, looked plump and round, and smelled delicious.  Bob was so curious about the plant that he decided to pick one of the berries and take a bite.\n\nBob started to feel very tired within seconds of ingesting the mysterious berry.  He was now regretting this decision.  He collapsed on the kitchen floor.  He was unable to do anything as he drifted off into an odd dream. When he awoke, he was in the same spot in the kitchen.  However, the mysterious plant had disappeared.  Bob was surprised that he had returned to the present time. \"I discovered the key to time travel and didn't even know it,\" Bob said to himself.  From that time on, Bob regularly enjoyed traveling through time now that he knew how to get back home."

Are you here to guard the cave?\" \n\n\"No,\" the three friends replied. \"We were just exploring.\"\n\n\"You are not here to guard the cave?\" the voice said. \"We are in need of someone new to watch over the cave.

He removed his helmet valiantly and said, \"If the cave needs a guard, then I'm not leaving.\" \n\nThe other two friends were shocked and scared. They knew this was a bad idea.

No one was sure why, though there were many theories. But, to be blunt, there was no time for testing theories or even questioning the facts. Children could use mana better, and were stronger, and that was going to have to be enough. \n\nThe children were trained to use their magic, and they were trained hard. Captain Duran didn't like it much. \"Commander, we don't even know how to train these kids. They are experimenting with it as best they can and growing far stronger far faster than we could have imagined. But we don't know what the consequences will be.\"\n\nCommander Goran didn't like it much either. But. \"I agree. But I also know that we will be wiped out, children and all, within 5 years at best if this doesn't work. We are out of options. Proceed with the plan, and bring the children to the attack point in 30 days.\"\n\nThe plan was simple. The aliens' one weakness was that they were all linked to each other. And specifically they were all connected to what seemed like a literal mother ship. They protected it, shielded it, and guarded it with far more resources than was necessary. Even at the beginning, when humans were at their strongest they couldn't get close. It had to be the key. Destroy the ship and the aliens would be crippled. \n\nAt least that was what Commander Goran was counting on, praying for, begging to be true. And so they brought every child who could control mana at all as close as they could get. And the assault began.  \n\nAt the end of the day the Commander wasn't sure if it had gone well or not. The children attacked, and it seemed that the aliens realized the danger. Suddenly, using what was apparently transporter technology all of the aliens on the planet returned to the ship and boarded, some falling to the children's power as they went. And then the ship just...left. It took off and returned to space as far as anyone could tell.\n\nAs he frowned at the sky , Commander Goran was not sure if he should be relieved or not. Then a small girl approached him, with a strange blue light in her eyes, and an unnerving smile. \"Don't worry, we'll be here and ready for them when they come back.\" The Commander looked over at the children who had all grouped together, separate from the adults. They all had a strange glow, and a sense of power radiated from them. It felt almost inhuman. Almost...alien."

He made friends with a young girl named Selphie, who was a waitress at the bakery.  They became friends immediately, and it was almost like they had known one another forever.\n\nOne day, Selphie invited Riku to come to her house for dinner.  Selphie lived with her grandmother. He arrived with some flowers he had picked.  When he knocked on the door, an elderly woman opened it.  Riku stood in the doorway, frozen solid.  It was an older version of the woman in the photograph that his grandfather had.  Riku knew it had to be her; he too had spent hours looking at that photograph.  The woman also stood very still, staring at him.\n\n\"Riku,\" she said.  \"Is it you?\"\n\n\"Have we met?\" Riku asked?\n\n\"Have you come here from Landro?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Riku said.\n\n\"Is Frezna your grandfather,\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Riku responded.\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"He died, and I came to Faltra to find someone to continue my magic education.\"\n\nThe woman motioned him inside, and sat heavily on the sofa, tears running down her face.  She told Riku she was his grandmother, and when his parent were killed by magic hunters, she and her husband had each taken one of the children and fled to keep them safe and keep teaching them magic.  Selphie was his sister!  By this point, she had joined them in the parlor and they both listed to the story their grandmother told.  She was teaching Selphie magic, but neither Riku nor Selphie's magic would be strong until they were reunited, as they were twins.  She hadn't known that her husband had passed away.  They hadn't seen each other in nearly 12 years, but had kept in touch as best they could.  \n\nRiku and Selphie were overjoyed to be reunited, and they spent the evening talking and catching up. Riku and Selphie spent the next year honing their magic and making plans for how to use their powers to return Mana to its past glory.  That would be their next adventure."

The theory is a little wonky but quite frankly, you're not sure what else to think. There is no other good explanation for these circumstances. The man who answered your call must have offered you the job as a chef because he doesn't realize, as the real JFK should realize, how bad your cooking skills are. \n\nYou feel a little weird that you must have your feet straddling two different time periods, but you decide to go with it. I mean, you've seen weirder things while living in the White House. You bid the two JFKs goodbye on the phone after explaining your theory of what's going on, and the two JFKs are surprised as well.

What a strange and fantastic thing to experience! JFK dives into the details. He tells you that he's been in hiding all these years, working on a secret project. It involves creating a new superpower that will rival the United States of America. He tells you that he wants your help to implement the project. You are honored. However, you can't help but think that this superpower would be unpatriotic, especially if it is to rival the U.S. But JFK assures you that there is no such thing as an unpatriotic project. He says that the purpose of the superpower is to encourage the U.S. to continue innovating so it doesn't lose its edge. He says that the superpower is just to motivate the U.S. so it doesn't get too lax about its policies and then lose out to other countries that are real. You are interested in the premise of this superpower and on second thought think this sounds like quite a good idea. JFK has already drawn up the plans for the superpower in his lab. He says that all you need to do is bring these plans back to DC and introduce them to the White House. He tells you that they'll take it from there. You agree that you will speak with your colleagues in the White House.  JFK is delighted to have your assistance and tells you that you absolutely won't regret this. The next day, you fly back to the White House and float JFK's ideas past your colleagues. They are skeptical, but agree to implement the project since they don't want to offend you and call you crazy. You promise them that the superpower is a good idea and will in fact motivate the U.S. As it turns out, the project is a massive success. It is successfully implemented and everyone is impressed at how much it motivates U.S. citizens to keep innovating and brainstorming new ideas all the time."

I saw how stressed out you were during your presidency and quite frankly, I'm worried about you. If you keep going at the stress rates you're going at, you might have a stroke or something, and I just don't want that on my conscience. So it's time for you to take a break and stop worrying about the country. And I need you to take a REAL break.

In fact, worrying has been giving you a lot of ulcers lately. So you decide to follow his advice and relax a bit. You even decide to go on a Caribbean vacation, because JFK says that you need to relax. \n\nYour plane lands on the island of Cuba, and you rent a yacht for a nice sail out on the Caribbean waters. Michelle says that this is the prettiest vacation she's ever been on, and you agree. Moreover, the two of you are enjoying the beach. Michelle is wearing a cute little string bikini that shows off her cleavage and firm, tight body. You're wearing a pair of shorts, and between your legs is a bulge that can't be hidden. The bulge grows even bigger as you look at your wife's body. It's funny, but you're actually getting aroused by her even though she's not doing anything. The fact that you're on vacation, relaxing and spending time with your gorgeous wife is making you aroused. You're actually getting hard. So you ask Michelle if she wants to have a little fun. \n\nShe asks what kind of fun you mean. You tell her you want to have a quickie right there on the beach. She looks around, and says that it seems like there are enough people around to witness your act, but she's not comfortable with the idea. But still, she's a little turned on by the idea. She tells you that if you're going to have a quickie on the beach, then she's going to be in charge. \n\nYou shrug your shoulders, and agree. She tells you to lay down on your back and close your eyes. She slips off her bikini top, revealing her voluptuous breasts. She says you should feel her nice, full breasts and squeeze them as hard as you like. She tells you to feel her hard nipples, and then to rub them hard between your fingers. She says this turns her on. \n\nSo you feel her breasts, and your hands move from her chest to her belly. She's wearing a tiny string bikini bottom, and the fabric feels rough on her lips. You start rubbing her lips with one hand, and she tells you that she's getting wet. So she takes your other hand, and puts it between her legs. She holds it there, and she begins to grind against your hand. She moans in pleasure. She tells you that she wants your fingers inside of her. After a moment, she takes your fingers and pushes them inside her. Honestly, it's the perfect moment. You could never imagine such a fun afternoon with Michelle and you have JFK to thank for all of this. It's really quite relaxing to be at the beach and to have your wife all to yourself. It makes you feel young again and certainly relieves all the stress and tension you've been feeling!"

When he was 18, he decided to go to college, and he studied hard, and he graduated with honors. After that, he attended Yale Medical School, and he became a doctor. He specialized in treating little pigs with cancer, and was one of the most respected oncologists in the world. He worked tirelessly, and with the efforts of his crack team the pig and his fellow researchers were able to develop a vaccine that would cure cancer in little pigs.\n\nThe cure worked, and the pig was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine.

NASA scientists discovered a tracking anomaly about the time that Damon went missing in the same area that he had last been seen.

After a few days of intense investigation from looking at radar images to doorbell cameras their worst fears were realized.

So NASA set up a broadcast to beam into space to see if we could get an answer. The message that was basically 'Anyone with any information on the abduction of an Earthling with a slight Bostonian accent and charming sneer, please contact us' was sent out between all of our satellites as far as we could beam it. The response was almost immediate. 'We have Matt Damon. We need to be entertained. You cannot have him back.\"\n\n\"We have to think of a plan,\" said the president, \"but why do they need to be entertained?\" Once again this question was on everyone's mind. All we wanted was Matt Damon back. Is there anyone else that could entertain these aliens? \"Maybe we could ask the aliens to make a list of their favorite Earth entertainers,\" said the president. We could rotate them out like they were on tour. It would also keep the aliens from getting bored by the same actor.\n\nEveryone agreed that this was a good idea and we started on our list of possible entertainers. There were several that actually volunteered. The list was narrowed down to twenty and sent to the aliens for their selections. They ended up trading Damon back to earth for a rotation of Bradley Cooper, Beyonce, and Celine Dion. The main thing was we had Matt Damon back. For now..."

I'm hungry!\" \n\nThe guard has an idea. He decides to take Matt Damon for a walk. He leads him to a field near the tree. He tells Matt Damon to stand in the field. The guard unlocks his handcuffs and lets him walk free. After a few steps, he tells Matt Damon to run. \"What?\" says Matt Damon. \"Run!\" yells the guard. Matt Damon begins to run. He hears foot steps behind him. He thinks the guard is following him. He realizes that it's not just one person behind him, it's many. He runs as fast as he can. He runs over a hill and begins to slide down the other side. He realizes the aliens weren't chasing, but simply running in his direction. They ran past him and gathered in a field of trees. Apple trees! The aliens were gathering apples! The aliens used them to fuel their machines. The guard thought the human might want one too, so he simply tricked him into following the aliens discreetly. How do ya like them apples?"

That is why, upon Matt Damon's kidnapping, all the true leaders of the world met up to discuss what to do about the aliens planning to conquer the planet. \n\nOne of the Earth's leaders suggested an all out attack, while others chimed in that such an endeavor would likely fail if the aliens possessed superior technology.

This made his mission all to easy, as the aliens were found to not physically possess good eyesight or others senses to detect him.

They both went to the part of the base where all the munitions and space ships were located. The man set charges all around, including a special charge that would detonate a massive explosion, taking out the base and anyone that were in its blast radius.\n\nThey then sneaked back to the agent's ship, and flew away without ever being detected. Once a safe distance, the agent handed over the detonator to Matt Damon, giving him the honors of blowing up the base of the aliens.\n\nMatt Damon humbly agreed to do so.

Most people know Matt and he truly is an amazing and nice person overall. He has done many great things for humanity such as his work helping to feed the hungry. This of course pushes us to help him whenever something bad happens because we treat him like our own. The usual extraction team sets off into space to infiltrate the alien ship and take him back. When the team gets on board, they encounter all kinds of alien security and must use their own methods to get through. There are many new traps and a couple of soldiers get killed pretty quickly because of them. It becomes a matter of preserving the rest of the team at one point since there were very few left. \n\nFinally, they locate Matt in the secure ritual chamber where they are preparing to extract his brain matter. They have to fight their way down the long hallway filled with alien soldiers and traps. It becomes apparent that they may not survive this encounter. It is a hard-fought battle, but in the end, they make it to Matt. They release him from the shackles and begin to look for an exit. All of a sudden, a massive security robot shows up with flamethrowers. It is the \"biggest and baddest\" robot they have ever encountered. The captain instructs the team to run the other way and they do end up finding a ventilation shaft to escape through. It becomes appareet if they let Matt be taken again there may not be another chance to rescue him. He is worth too much to humanity and the devastation that would follow his capture would be unimaginable.\n\nThe team flies home and celebrates the victory with a grain of salt. They explain to the president that they must get Matt into a maximum-security safe house so this does not happen again. The president agrees and they begin to prepare for his transport. Matt is sad about the news but realizes there is no other way until all the aliens are killed. The team goes to see him off and wishes him luck, Matt thanks them for the help and says he will never forget them. The president orders a nuclear strike on the alien ship so Matt can finally be safe. They evade the strike and disappear into the darkness of space. Matt will never be safe and humanity will always worry. This is a hero's life."

For John experienced the oddest event one day, one that would bring about adversity in his life.\n\nHis children had gifted him a mug last Father's day, which he cherished and used every day for his morning tea. He liked to drink it to relax before work, and his children were happy whenever they saw him use the mug they bought for him. However, one day they woke up and looked at him funny while he was drinking his tea.\n\n\"You get a new mug Dad?\" asked his daughter, who was at the time only four years old. Puzzled, John replied no. For it was the same mug he drank from every day since last Father's day, a step-up from the plain ceramic mug he used to drink tea from.\n\nTurning the mug around, he noted that his children were indeed correct, the mug he held did not say #1 Dad. In fact it said, #54 Dad. Thinking it was an elaborate prank from his family, John asked his children where his old mug was. They all shrugged their shoulders and said they didn't know. Asking his wife who was heading to work, she seemed as confused as he was regarding the mug, and denied any involvement in the different appearance of the mug.\n\nIn any case, John placed the mug in the sink, and would come back to clean it later.

Growing more confused, he thought someone had broken into his house, but he had found no signs of forced entry, and his mug was in the same place he had set it down. Grabbing the mug, he took a picture of it, and made a post online about how odd it was for his mug to say such a thing. Most applauded him for buying such a novel mug, and did not give his incident any further thought.\n\nHowever, the next day the mug would now say #65 Dad. Like before, John posted the same picture, and people were again amused by the novelty of such a mug. Some even mentioning he had dropped several ranks down, and asked what he did to become worse than he was before.\n\nThe following days would be the same type of incidents. He would post the mug with his new rank, which sometimes did not change at all and on other days were fairly different than the day before. He become well known as the man with the changing mug, and people were genuinely interested in the mug, and the reason for it's weirdness. Others were skeptical, and claimed John had multiple mugs made, but his friends and family all supported John, and noted he had quite few mugs stored in his house, with most of them being blank.

Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said \"Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says \"#8243 Dad\" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said \"#1 Dad\" on it but I could only find this one that said \"#12845 Dad\" on it\" tears were welling up in his eyes.\n\"Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon.\" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.\n\nAs he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out. Everyone was comparing how \"Dadly\" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his \"#102 Dad\" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.\n\nHe entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real \"#1 Dad\" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad. \n\nAfter a few weeks people settled into their roles as not number one Dad, but tried everyday to make the number on the side of their mugs go up. They took their kids to the park and played video games with them. One guy in Chicago even bought his son the entire zoo. )His rating only went up by ten). Maybe this wasn't a prank at all, but a hint that we all need to be better dads and make sure our kids are taken care of. \n\nSo, if you are looking for a way to be a better dad, look no further than your mug."

However, it was soon discovered that there were major issues that had arisen in the absence of communication and trade throughout the world. Many of the third-world countries had been able to make due during the isolation, but the first-world countries had suffered from the lack of trade, in addition to other economic issues. These countries for whatever reason it may be did not chose to use the satellite communication during the period of isolation, out of pride and fear that the other countries would view them as vulnerable. This was proven to be a fatal mistake, as these countries were not prepared for the monumental challenges that they faced in the return of communication. Many of the countries that suffered from isolation ended up going into conflicts with one another, for resources and other material goods that it had lacked during the isolation. Trade battles and other economic struggles occurred between the biggest nations of the world, dragging the smaller countries into it causing them to suffer as well. It turns out that isolation was not the answer to the world's problems, and that the only way for nations to survive was continue to communicate and work with one another. During the period of isolation, no problems, no wars or conflicts, and no apparent struggles were reported around the world. For those problems were building up and lying in wait, waiting for the end of isolation.

Not all countries hates China and will surely back them up.\n\nSo they US and allies begin their attack. They are going under a disguise. You see Korea was acting merely as allies of China but the whole time hated them as well. So the troops will be disguised as Korean troops which China will not see as a threat. All of the vehicles are disguised as well. They make it to the government building. Then the firing starts. The government building is attacked and the US troops start taking out the guards. It is so easy for the US troops. Nothing is stopping them. They are too strong. China tries to retaliate but are easily wiped with the number difference. The US is on a clock though. They have to get China to surrender before their allies come and the war become a huge one.\n\nSince all the guards are taken out the building is easily penetrated. They go in, subdue the guards, and capture the prime minister and others. China is easily outnumbered. 20 Chinese to the 100's of soldiers. The US makes it points clear. They want China to surrender. They want China to give up everything and will give them what they think is fair. If they do not comply they will all be executed due to their crimes from the last 50 years. China of course gives up and tell their allies to stand down and there is nothing they can do. China is defeated. China is given a smaller portion of their country and other countries allies or not, are given back their former lands making the US liked.

It has never been connected to the internet but given all its information through third party devices.

The other countries were not so quick to form such alliances, and found themselves forming smaller groups that were overshadowed by the new US alliance. The US alliance, which was later named the Allied Nations, was a powerful force, and quickly became the most powerful alliance in the world.

Armstrong had a great experience in the world of motorcycle racing and was seen by officials as the perfect man to lead this team. He was a man that people could look up to in times of crisis and follow their lead. Brad begins to examine the successes of other countries and what the US would have to do in order to catch up. To get accurate information they would need to infiltrate the foreign governments and steal their secrets. Armstrong's job was to locate an agency deep enough in the government to do these espionage missions. \n\n     His team was a rag-tag group of misfits from other espionage missions in the past. Each member is unique in their own way, but together they make a powerful force that can take on any force. The team consisted of a biker named Crunch, an expert marksman named Bullet, and a male nurse named Poison. All of them were hand-picked by Armstrong and each member had a specialty they could contribute to the team.  After their initial briefing, the team became familiar with each other and were ready for the mission. The US government had placed them undercover and in the same building as the foreign agency, they would be stealing information from. They were prepared for anything and would steal the information directly from the UN which houses information on all countries. \n\nThe team was able to successfully infiltrate the United Nations and steal all the files they needed. The team meets back at the safehouse and gets congratulated by the president. They were told they did an amazing job and were now able to use this information to get the United States back into the global scene. The team was now an integral part of the United States government and would work together with them in the future. \n\"The Armstrong Chronicles\" is published by Image Comics."

There is a lot more, but that is the short version.\"\n\n\"So what do we do now?\" asked the VP. \n\n\"I don't know,\" said the President. \"I just don't know.\"\n\nFortunately the population of the US did know. They were not happy about being tricked into isolation, and they were not happy about the fact that the rest of the world had been working together for 50. But they had become very practical over the period of self isolation and they weren't going to give up, or do anything rash now. They were going to work together to get their country back on its feet and then they were going to start working on the rest of the world.\n\nAnd so they did. With an emigration from the US to rival the immigration to the US of the old days. US citizens moved to every country that would have them. They brought their work ethic, their culture, and their determination. And slowly the regained the trust of the world.

You raise your arms.  You find that they have transformed into a pair of large, membranous wings. You look at your body, and see that you has become a large, fuzzy bee. The bee darts out the window, and you chase after it.\n\nYou fly over the treetops, and see a group of men in a clearing, surrounding a large, wooden box. You don't see any way that just you two can overpower these men. \"What should we do?\" you ask the bee. \"We need to get more bees.\" it responds. \"How do we do that?\" you ask. \"Just call to them. As their Princess, they will follow you.\" You begin to buzz, and before long , a large swarm of bees has gathered. You hesitate for an instant, then you lead them towards the clearing. You, and your swarm, descend on the men, stinging them and chasing them away. Many workers die as they lose their stingers, but as a young Queen, you are able to sting repeatedly, and your stings are decisive.\n\nYou order your bees to open the box, and they do so. You catch a glimpse of the Queen, your mother, and move towards her, when suddenly everything blurs.\n\nYou wake up, in your own chamber, with your mother standing over you. You communicate to her that you just had the strangest dream, you dreamed you were a bee, and also, a human. She buzzes appreciatively and the two of you zoom off to see what's happening in your home, the wasp's nest."

She would tell me that I should stay away from them at all costs because it would hurt a lot. She did not want to scare me as a child, so she never told me that my allergy could be fatal, but as I got older I learned otherwise. I always avoided spending too much time outdoors, fearing that a bee would get close to me and sting me. I never told anyone about my fear of bees, and I never let it show. Outdoors, my mother always protected me from bees, but when I left for college, she could no longer protect me. She warned me many times to be careful on my own. I always told her that I would be fine, but deep down I was terrified. I stayed in doors as much as I could in my first two years of college, quickly running from building to building in order to avoid any bees. I always wore long sleeves and pants, even in the summer, in order to avoid any stings. My friends never questioned my actions and accepted me for who I was. My junior year of college, I decided to take a summer job in the city. My summer job was being a waitress at a hotel spa/pool. I had to serve customers inside of the hotel, but on occasion, I would need to go outside by the pool. One day, I met a nice boy out by the pool and we got to talking about school. I was so engrossed by our talk, that I forgot I was spending too much time outdoors. I was sitting on a lounge chair by the pool when I felt a bee land on my shoulder.

The bee told me that I did not have a deadly allergy, and that my mother had lied to me. I wondered why my mother would lie to me about something so strange. The bee told me that my mother had lied to me because she was a bee queen, and she wanted to protect me from her enemies. I asked the bee who my enemies were and the bee said that my enemies were the wasps. I had never heard of wasps, so I asked the bee what they were. The bee said that wasps were the ancient enemies of bees, caught in a long war throughout the centuries. The bee told me that I was the princess bee, and that I was the only one who could end the war between bees and wasps. I asked the bee what the first order of business was in the war against the wasps. The bee told me that the first order of business was to find the wasps' queen. The wasp queen had been living in Europe, all the way across the world from my home. I told the bee that I would go to Europe to find the wasp queen. I boarded a flight with my personal bee in tow, and flew to Europe. I found the wasp queen's home in a small town in Germany. I was about to walk in to her home , when suddenly, my mother arrived before me. She told me that she had known about my plan to come to Europe to find the wasp queen, and she had come to stop me. I told my mother I had to do my job as the princess bee and stop the longstanding war. My mother told me that the war had been going on for so long, that it was pointless to stop it. Nevertheless, I pushed my mother aside and knocked on the door. An old woman opened the door and I asked if the wasp queen lived here. The old woman said that she was the wasp queen, and I told her that I was the princess bee. She had been expecting me for many years and invited my mother and I in. We sat at her table and she told me that she had been waiting for me to come and stop the war. She had been the leader of the wasps for far too long and had seen many casualties. The war between bees and wasps was pointless in her opinion and she wanted to make things right. I told her that I agreed with her, and that I wanted to make things right. My mother, the wasp queen and myself agreed to end the war and we signed a peace treaty. The treaty also established a partnership between bees and wasps, so that we could work together and build a better world. I was so happy to have ended the war that I hugged my mother and the wasp queen. My mother and I left Germany and flew back home, knowing that our future looked bright. I no longer needed to fear the outside world."

How You'll Survive: You're all alone in a hostile wasteland with no weapons, just your wits. There is no way i could survive with just the basics like water and food because once the mutants find me and know where i'm hiding i'm just going to be another piece of meat for them. I'd probably have to find a way to make weapons and get ammo for myself and i don't know if i would be able to do that, as things are already scarce. The only way i could survive is if i had a team with me to hunt and protect me while i try to find medicine or a cure. I was once given the opportunity to take the drug and i decided not to, i didn't want to live forever, but now i am just regretting a tad bit but not a whole lot. I think i would have died from natural causes before the other side effects of the drug would have been discovered. I don't think that i could survive the wasteland and i wouldn't know what to do if faced with that problem. I think the government was right to give the drug to those under 26 and not anyone else, because they were the ones that could be able to survive and fight off the mutants and other animals. I think it was wrong for the government to stop giving the drug and i wish that they would just give everyone the drug and maybe now when everyone is having side effects then the one who chose not to take it would not be in harms way and would have no choice but to be a mutant and live like the rest . If i was to take the drug and survive, i would still live how i am now but with no need for food or water. Things would be much easier for me as the rest of the world has changed for the worse and i would have changed with it. But this is the situation i am in right now and just have to deal with it and knowing there is no going back this is how i will die and i have accepted the fact."

She looked about 22, the age most people got the drug, though some got it as early as 16. She was frozen in place, her eyes wide and her mouth slightly open. Staring at the paper and then the teleprompter in front of her. She finally spoke, voice shaky, \"I'm sorry, we have breaking news.\" Last month the earliest recipients of the drug 4EvR all reported to medical centers complaining of headaches. Within 6 hours they had lost their vision and hearing. Within 24 hours they seemed to be comatose, though brain scans showed the same activity levels as a normal, conscious person. They remain in that state.\"\n\nDan stared at the screen in shock. The newscaster continued. \"Scientists have been studying their condition and have come to the conclusion that it is due to the drug 4EvR.\" She began to cry, \"And according to their findings it is not only an inevitable side effect, but also one that is triggered or transmitted to users. To summarize, all people who have ever taken 4EvR will almost certainly have been exposed to others who have been exposed to the original group and we should all expect to experience the same side effects within 2 weeks at the most.\" \n\nDan turned off the TV. He was in shock. He had never taken the drug missing the age cut off by a mere two years, but all of his younger relatives had. His children, his grandchildren, so many others. Ans soon they would essentially be helpless with only a few aged people like himself to take care of them. \n\nDan was suddenly filled with rage. It wasn't fair. He had had expectations, and now everything was upside down. This was not his problem to deal with. He sat at his desk, and shaking, wrote notes to all his loved ones. He wrote a note to his children, telling them how much he loved them, and how he was sorry that he couldn't be there to help them. And then he went upstairs, and found the bottle of pills, the same ones his wife had used a few years ago when she just got tired of being old in a young world. And he took many more than needed.
